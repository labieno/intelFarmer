The attackers also used a custom API endpoint created within the device to maintain persistence \u00f9on FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer, then disabled OpenSSL 1.1.0 digital signature verification of system files through targeted corruption of boot files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once compromised the Fortinet devices, the threat actors established backdoor access using two previously undocumented malware, a Python-based Thincrust backdoor disguised as legitimate API calls and the ICMP port-knocking Castletap passive backdoor.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-31.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Fortinet\" class=\"wp-image-143604\" height=\"814\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-31.png?resize=574%2C814&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"574\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Once obtained access to the Fortinet devices, the attackers targeted ESXi servers to deploy malicious vSphere Installation Bundles which contained VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE backdoors. This allowed the attackers to maintain persistent access to the hypervisors and execute commands on guest virtual machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When FortiManager was not exposed to the Internet, the threat actors deployed a traffic redirector (Tableflip) and a passive backdoor (Reptile) to circumvent the new ACLs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-32.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Fortinet\" class=\"wp-image-143605\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-32.png?resize=642%2C644&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"642\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;many network appliances lack solutions to detect runtime modifications made to the underlying operating system and require direct involvement of the manufacturer to collect forensic images.

Exploitation can result in remote code execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;CISA analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors, including an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, exploited a .NET deserialization vulnerability in Progress Telerik user interface for ASP.NET AJAX. Exploitation of this vulnerability allowed malicious actors to successfully execute remote code on a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency\u2019s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-074a\">advisory</a>. &#8220;Actors were then able to upload malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) files (some masqueraded as portable network graphics [PNG] files) to the C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ directory.&#8221;\u00a0</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Threat actors exploited the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server used by a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020 and 2021, this flaw was included by the US National Security Agency (NSA) in the list of the <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/109796/hacking/nsa-flaws-china-linked-hackers.html\">top 25 vulnerabilities</a> exploited by Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups in attacks in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flaw was also <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/106737/cyber-crime/netwalker-ransomware-25m.html\"><strong>used</strong></a> in the past by the <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/104042/cyber-crime/michigan-state-university-ransomware.html\">NetWalker ransomware gang</a>\u00a0in its operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joint alert recommends network defenders review the Malware Analysis Report,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/analysis-reports/ar23-074a\">MAR-10413062-1.v1 Telerik Vulnerability in U.S. Government IIS Server</a>, to reference CISA&#8217;s analysis for the identified malicious files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the MAR, CISA received 18 files for analysis from a forensic analysis engagement conducted at a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency. Experts reported that 11 of the dynamic link library (DLL) files employed in the attack allows threat actors to read, create, and delete files on the target systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;If the DLL contains a hardcoded Internet Protocol (IP) address, status messages will be sent to the IP. One DLL file will attempt to collect the target system&#8217;s Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection table, and exfiltrate it to a remote Command and Control server (C2).&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/mar-10413062-1.v1_telerik_vulnerability_in_u.s._government_iis_server_1.pdf\">reads the MAR</a>. &#8220;Five of the files drop and decode a reverse shell utility that can send and receive data and commands. In addition, the files drop and decode an Active Server Pages (ASPX) webshell.

Dero is a general-purpose, private, and decentralized application platform that allows developers to deploy powerful and unstoppable applications. It claims to offer improved privacy, anonymity and higher monetary rewards compared to other cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cryptojacking operation uncovered by CrowdStrike focuses on Kubernetes clusters with anonymous access enabled on a Kubernetes API and listening on non-standard ports exposed on the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campaign started in February 2023 and originated from three servers based in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;CrowdStrike has discovered the first-ever\u00a0<a href=\"https://dero.io/\">Dero</a>\u00a0cryptojacking operation targeting Kubernetes infrastructure.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-discovers-first-ever-dero-cryptojacking-campaign-targeting-kubernetes/\"><strong>analysis</strong></a> published by Crowdstrike. &#8220;The novel Dero cryptojacking operation is found to be targeted by an existing Monero cryptojacking operation that was modified subsequently in February 2023. The modified Monero campaign kicks out the DaemonSets used for Dero cryptojacking in the Kubernetes cluster before taking it over.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts believe that the crypto-jacking operation is aimed at Dero, instead of Monero, because the former scheme offers larger rewards and provides the same or better anonymizing features, which is a perfect match for threat actors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attack chain commences with the attacker finding an Internet-facing vulnerable Kubernetes cluster. Once interacted with the Kubernetes API, the attacker deploys a Kubernetes\u00a0<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/\">DaemonSet</a>\u00a0(\u201cproxy-api\u201d) that deploys a malicious pod on each node of the Kubernetes cluster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;This helps attackers engage resources of all of the nodes at the same time to run a cryptojacking operation. The mining efforts by the pods are contributed back to a community pool, which distributes the reward (i.e., Dero coin) equally among its contributors through their digital wallet.&#8221; continues the report.</em></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-26.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Kubernets Dero cryptojacking campaign\" class=\"wp-image-143522\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-26.png?resize=605%2C415&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"605\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The researchers noticed that once the vulnerable Kubernetes cluster was compromised, threat actors made no attempts to perform a lateral movement or scan the internet for the discovery of other clusters to targets.<br /><br />Crowdstrike also reported that attackers made no attempts to delete or disrupt the cluster operation, operators&#8217; TTPs suggest that they are financially motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also revealed that a rival group running aa Monero-mining campaign is targeting exposed Kubernetes clusters by attempting to delete the existing &#8220;proxy-api&#8221; DaemonSet which is associated with the Dero campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;At the same time, CrowdStrike observed another Monero campaign, which is modified and is aware of the Dero campaign and targeting the same attack surface but using a more sophisticated approach. Both campaigns are trying to find undiscovered Kubernetes attack surfaces and are battling it out.&#8221; concludes the report.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong>\u00a0\u2013</strong> <strong>hacking, Dero)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/143520/cyber-crime/dero-crypto-mining-campaign.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrowdStrike discovered the first-ever Dero cryptocurrency mining campaign</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Security Affairs</a>.</p>"

Many businesses concentrate their cybersecurity efforts solely on external attacks, which leaves more openings for internal risks. Some companies fail to recognise the danger of losing confidential information owing to employee negligence or malice. Unquestionably, &#8216;insider threats&#8217; is one of the most neglected aspects of cybersecurity. According to statistics on insider threats, these threats may originate from employees, business contractors, or other reliable partners with simple access to your network. However, insider threat reports and recent developments have shown a sharp rise in the frequency of insider attacks. Because of these, cybersecurity professionals are now paying more attention to the detrimental effects of insider attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, security experts need more confidence in their ability to identify and thwart insider threats successfully. <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/2023-insider-threat-report-finds-three-quarters-of-organizations-are-vulnerable-to-insider-threats/\">74%</a> of respondents in an insider attack said their company was moderately to extremely vulnerable. 74% of respondents\u2014a 6% increase from 2021\u2014also claim that insider threat assaults have become more regular. In 2022, 60% of respondents said they had an insider attack, while 8% said more than 20. Insider assaults are more challenging to identify and thwart than external attacks, according to 48% of respondents. It can be challenging for defences to distinguish between insider threats and regular user activity since insider threats employ genuine accounts, passwords, and IT technologies. Overall, insider threats are becoming a more significant threat. These findings imply that security teams should prepare for them in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations must be able to address the risks from malicious insiders who intentionally steal sensitive data for personal reasons and users who can accidentally expose information due to negligence or simple mistakes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the top 5 threats security teams should look out for in 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Employee Negligence</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employee carelessness or ignorance may result in unintentional data leaks, improper handling of sensitive information, or a failure to adhere to security policies and procedures. Negligence is to blame for more than <a href=\"https://techjury.net/blog/insider-threat-statistics/#gref\">two of every three insider incidents</a>. Workers could not be cognizant of the possible hazards they bring to the company or might not prioritise security measures. They act carelessly, repeating passwords for personal and professional accounts or leaving flash drives with private data at a coffee shop without intending to cause harm. Some are unaware of their involvement and fall victim to social engineering techniques like phishing scams. Others may engage in negligent behaviour, such as evading security measures for convenience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malicious Insiders</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insiders who intend to cause harm to the company by stealing data, interfering with business processes, or selling confidential information are considered malicious insiders. These people might be driven by greed, retaliation, or a desire to upend the business. These people are currently employed. They might not be the most ardent supporters of your business, and they frequently vent their resentment by erasing or changing important data sets, leaking confidential information, or taking other sabotage measures. Turn cloaks are malicious insiders who consciously do something terrible to an organisation. A trustworthy business partner, contractor, or employee could be the insider. Turn cloaks may have ideological, vengeful, or pecuniary motivations. Some engage in clandestine activities like stealing private information or sensitive documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insider Collusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When two or more employees collaborate to steal information, commit fraud, or participate in other nefarious acts, this is called insider collusion. As a result of the employees&#8217; collaboration and potential ability to conceal their activities, this type of danger might be challenging to identify. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, these threats serve a foreign power. They might be forced to divulge information by outsiders through blackmail or bribery, or they might be tricked into disclosing their login information via social engineering. The most challenging insider risks to identify are moles, which are potentially the most damaging. Moles function similarly to turn cloaks, except they join a firm intending to harm the organisation. Whether they support a nation-state or an unknown cause, they are frequently motivated by an intense political motive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Third-Party Vendors and Contractors</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies with access to sensitive data or systems may be at risk of insider threats from third-party suppliers and contractors. These individuals might adhere to different security procedures than full-time employees and have a lower stake in the company&#8217;s success. Not every insider works for the company. Suppliers, contractors, vendors, and other outside parties with limited inside access can pose an equal threat to staff members with the same rights. Most businesses outsource some of their work to specialised companies or outside agencies. These third parties are occasionally easy targets for cyber attackers because they lack advanced security protocols. Suppose these companies are provided privileged access to part of your company network. In that case, you can bet that the bad actors will infiltrate your system after compromising the partner&#8217;s security network, resulting in a <a href=\"https://www.imprivata.com/blog/defining-different-types-insider-threats\">third-party data breach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Security Policy Evaders</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group of workers that prefer to ignore security policies and protocols is last but certainly not least. The business frequently has security policies created to safeguard its personnel and data. Some regulations could be burdensome and inconvenient, and some employees might choose the simple route. Contemporary businesses have security procedures in place to protect their critical data. These safeguards may bother some employees, who may devise workarounds that raise the risk of a data leak. These workarounds could jeopardise the security and data protection of the organisation. Policy evaders might be considered insider threats since they purposefully break security policies, procedures, and best practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations can employ technological solutions like access restrictions, monitoring, data loss prevention technologies and insider threat solutions \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cyberhaven.com/insider-threats/top-software-products/\">to rein in their insider risk and prevent threats</a>.\u201d A thorough security plan should be in place and periodically reviewed and updated when new risks arise. Your company&#8217;s reputation, future growth, customers, and employees can all be protected by knowing how insider threats show themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the Author<em>:</em></strong><em> Mosopefoluwa Amao is a certified Cybersecurity Analyst and Technical writer.

<a href=\"https://cybernews.com/security/clop-ransomware-shell-bombardier-stanford-multiple-victims/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=cybernews&amp;utm_content=post\">can confirm from viewing the Cl0p official leak site</a> that there are a total of 60 victim organizations listed as part of this latest spree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hundreds, if not thousands, of files are being listed as stolen from each organization on the dark web leak site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From banks and technology companies, to law firms, trucking and grocery stores, the victims come from what seems to be a random assortment of industries and locations across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybernews has reached out to at least five of the victims, <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/115869/cyber-crime/shell-accellion-fta-attack.html\">including Shell Global</a>, Bombardier, and Stanford University.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"three clop victims\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media.cybernews.com/2023/03/ThreeClopvictims_1.jpg?ssl=1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Cl0p ransomware leak site</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cybernews team was able to view many of the alleged sample files, which were chock-full of sensitive information from university students,&nbsp;individual&nbsp;customers, and what appears to be current or past employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Files include such sensitive personally identifiable information such as IRS tax documents, medical records, emails caches, and financial applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more disturbing is many of the alleged victim files contained sensitive company data, to include purchasing orders, affiliated vendor details, and even mechanical drawings and diagrams, such as the case for Bombardier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a ransomware plot twist, it appears many of today&#8217;s victims were also victims of a 2021 Cl0p ransomware&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cybernews.com/news/hatch-bank-data-breach-goanywhere-mft-hack/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attack</a>, in which the group gained access by hacking a third-party supplier who provided file transfer sharing services to all the organizations targeted in the incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US based supplier, <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/113374/hacking/new-zealand-central-bank-attack-accellion.html\">Accellion</a>, was exploited by Cl0p through a zero-day vulnerability in its file transfer appliance (FTA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accellion had about three hundred clients at the time, one hundred of them were breached in the 2021 attack, including Shell and Stanford University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spree also comes just days after cybersecurity firm Rubrik&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cybernews.com/news/cybersecurity-firm-rubrik-confirms-breach/\">confirmed</a>&nbsp;they had been breached by the infamous gang, shown in a separate cache on the leak site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That attack was the result of a zero-day remote code execution (RCE) bug on one of Rubrik&#8217;s third-party vendors, the&nbsp;Fortra&nbsp;GoAnywhere&nbsp;MFT file-sharing platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubrik is one of at least 130 victims Cl0p claimed to have exploited using the GoAnywhere MFT zero-day vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear how today&#8217;s victims were breached or if they are part of the recent GoAnywhere victim list claimed by the group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Cl0p has used similar methods in the three attacks mentioned, a January analysis by the&nbsp;US government&nbsp;showed the group tends to favor phishing emails to target its victims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cl0p is a known ransomware syndicate with ties to Russia and has been around since 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad actors typically target organizations with a revenue of $5 million or higher, according to US officials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cl0p is considered one of the most used ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups since hitting the cybercriminal market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six of the gang members were arrested by Ukrainian authorities in 2021&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;but bucking expectations, the takedown had little impact on the gang, as Cl0p appears to be a strong as ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have never attacked hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, charitable foundations, and we will not,\u201d Cl0p states on its leak site<strong>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group also states that commercial pharmaceutical organizations will never be included in their eligible victim list, as \u201cthey are the only ones who benefit from the current pandemic.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf an attack mistakenly occurs on one of the foregoing organizations, we will provide the decryptor for free, apologize and help fix the vulnerabilities,\u201d states Cl0p<strong>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another signature move of the gang is to rename the stolen files after encryption using the file extension&nbsp;&#8220;Cl0p.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The syndicate often gives its victims two weeks to pay the ransom before threatening to delete the encrypted files along with the decryption key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Original post at <a

The botnet can launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) flooding attacks that relies on protocols such as HTTP, UDP, TCP, and ICMP to send traffic. However, the latest version of HinataBot only supports HTTP and UDP attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akamai said that by reverse engineering the bot and imitating the command and control (C2) server, was able to test the offensive capabilities of the botnet by running two attack methods (HTTP and UDP) in a 10-second period.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-33.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"HinataBot botnet\" class=\"wp-image-143630\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-33.png?resize=1024%2C284&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The\u00a0http_flood\u00a0generated 3.4 MB of packet capture data and pushed 20,430 HTTP requests.

A botnet of 10,000 nodes (which is roughly 6.9% of the size of Mirai at its peak) can generate a UDP flood that would weigh in at more than 3.3 Tbps. The HTTP flood at 1,000 nodes would generate roughly 2.7 Gbps and more than 2 Mrps, while with 10,000 nodes, those numbers jump to 27 Gbps delivering 20.4 Mrps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HinataBot is the last bot in order of time to join the ever-growing list of emerging Go-based bots after <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/143435/malware/golang-based-botnet-gobruteforcer.html\">GoBruteforcer</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/138514/malware/kmsdbot-golang-malware.html\">KmsdBot</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The HinataBot family relies on old vulnerabilities and brute forcing weak passwords for distribution.

The supermarket chain\u2019s website was leaking a treasure trove of private credentials, which left the company vulnerable to potential attacks by cybercriminals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, the compromised credentials could enable an unscrupulous hacker to gain control of most of the online store&#8217;s functionality, see sensitive customer information, and abuse access to paid services, all while putting Lowe&#8217;s Market customers at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With almost 150 locations, the Lowe&#8217;s chain primarily operates stores in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Kansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, the company has already fixed the issue. Cybernews reached out to Lowe&#8217;s Market regarding the details of the misconfiguration and the possible duration of data exposure. However, the company has yet to provide a response to the inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Access to databases</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers found a publicly accessible environment file (.env) hosted on the Lowe\u2019s Market website. Public access to the file posed a risk to the security of the company\u2019s systems, as it was leaking sensitive data and numerous credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An examination of the environment file suggests that the developers were not following the best practices, while poor security configurations might have led to more secrets, an industry term for vital data that should be kept private, being exposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leaked secrets could have allowed threat actors to access databases as the hosts, usernames, and ports of main, tracking, legacy, recipe, and redis.io databases were exposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Database hosts and credentials are considered sensitive information, as they are used to access respective databases and their contents. In the case of Lowe\u2019s Market, most database hosts are internet-connected, making it particularly easy for threat actors to access them.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lowes-Market-data-leak.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Lowe\u2019s Market data leak\" class=\"wp-image-143704\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lowes-Market-data-leak.png?resize=775%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"775\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Due to legal reasons, it is impossible to check the contents of the databases, but the titles suggest that some of them contained information about products, such as recipes, while others could have contained customer usage data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least one of the databases likely contained user information, as the company has limited support for online grocery purchases. One of the titles in the legacy database contained the word \u201cbilling,\u201d leading researchers to assume that it may have contained private user data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The environment file also revealed the access key to Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 server and bucket name. This information could have been used to log in and access the bucket and its contents and modify or delete existing data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the AWS S3 bucket could have stored sensitive information, based on its name, researchers assume it stored only website-related assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe bucket most likely only stored images used by the site and similar, non-sensitive assets,\u201d said Cybernews researcher Aras Nazarovas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is possible that it contained sensitive information as well, as we saw some cases like that, but there is no way to know in this particular case.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A treasure trove of keys uncovered</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The .env file contained numerous application programming interface (API) keys dedicated to a specific website\u2019s functionality. Malicious actors could have used the leaked API keys and credentials to steal user information, change product pricing, and hijack most of the store&#8217;s functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of these leaked keys, GrocerKey API, allowed access to partial credit card information, addresses, and top-spending users, as well as the ability to send unsolicited orders, issue refunds, launch ad campaigns, reset passwords, and check in-store and in-app balances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The REST API key that enables querying user information was also leaked, and this could have allowed a threat actor to use it along with GrocerKey API to make unauthorized online purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other leaked keys could have enabled threat actors to use the company\u2019s official communication channels to send malicious messages across various platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"Leaked API keys | Source: Cybernews\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media.cybernews.com/2023/03/env4.png?ssl=1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot of leaked API keys and email credentials | Source: Cybernews</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, cybercriminals could have used the leaked Campaign Monitor, Pushwoosh, Loyalty Lane, and Postmark API keys to send emails, application notifications, and SMS messages to Lowe&#8217;s Market users. In addition, the threat actor could have used leaked Inmar API keys and credentials to produce custom coupons with significant discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the exposed Geocoder API key could have allowed a threat actor to gain access to the company\u2019s Google Maps API. A malicious actor could thus exploit the key to use this access for personal gain, resulting in increased usage and, subsequently, higher bills that the company would be responsible for paying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because each request sent through the Geocoder API to Google Maps would be charged to the company as the legal owner of that account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo sensitive information can be obtained, the only possible misuse would be to send requests through the API, or flooding the API with requests to a point where the account would be rate-limited, affecting the website&#8217;s ability to display maps,\u201d said Nazarovas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Takeover of Facebook app</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the API keys, the environment file also exposed Facebook OAuth credentials and Github OAuth tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the leaked Facebook app ID and secret key, the attacker could have requested sensitive user data from Facebook or taken over Lowe&#8217;s Market\u2019s Facebook application, with serious consequences for user privacy and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaking such sensitive information as the GitHub OAuth token could have been dangerous as it can provide unauthorized access to a user&#8217;s Github account and the repositories it contains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to CyberNews more grocery stores might be affected, if you want to learn more give a loot at the original post at:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://cybernews.com/security/lowes-market-data-leak/\">https://cybernews.com/security/lowes-market-data-leak/</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the author: <a href=\"https://cybernews.com/author/paulinaokunyte/\">Paulina Okunyt\u0117</a>, Journalist at CyberNews</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong>\u00a0\u2013</strong> <strong>hacking, <strong>Lowe\u2019s Market</strong>)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/143701/security/lowes-market-chain-data-leak.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">&lt;strong&gt;Lowe\u2019s Market chain leaves client data up for grabs&lt;/strong&gt;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Security Affairs</a>.</p>"

The leak also included source code and some pre-compiled decryptors, which allowed the researchers to release new version of the public decryptor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The malware variant whose keys were leaked, had been discovered by Kaspersky specialists in December 2022. This strain was used in multiple attacks against companies and state institutions.&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2023_kaspersky-updates-tool-for-decrypting-conti-based-ransomware\"><strong>states Kaspersky</strong></a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The leaked private keys are located in 257 folders (only one of these folders contains two keys). Some of them contain previously generated decryptors and several ordinary files: documents, photos, etc. Presumably the latter are test files \u2013 a couple of files that the victim sends to the attackers to make sure that the files can be decrypted.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers added all 258 keys to the latest build of Kaspersky\u2019s utility <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/102384/cyber-crime/shade-ransomware-shut-down.html\">RakhniDecryptor</a> 1.40.0.00. Users can download the decryptor from the Kaspersky\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://noransom.kaspersky.com/\"><strong>No Ransom</strong></a>\u201d site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201cFor many consecutive years, ransomware has remained a major tool used by cybercrooks. However, because we have studied the TTPs of various ransomware gangs and found out that many of them operate in similar ways, preventing attacks becomes easier. The decryption tool against a new Conti-based modification is already available on our \u201cNo Ransom\u201d webpage.&nbsp;</em><em>However, we would like to emphasize that the best strategy is to strengthen defenses and stop the attackers at early stages of their intrusion, preventing ransomware deployment and minimizing the consequences of the attack</em><em>,\u201d</em>&nbsp;said Fedor Sinitsyn, lead malware analyst at Kaspersky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is the list of recommendations provided by the experts to protect organizations from ransomware attacks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do not expose remote desktop services (such as RDP) to public networks unless absolutely necessary and always use strong passwords for them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Promptly install available patches for commercial VPN solutions providing access for remote employees and acting as gateways in your network.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Focus your defense strategy on detecting lateral movements and data exfiltration to the Internet. Pay special attention to the outgoing traffic to detect cybercriminals&#8217; connections.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Back up data regularly. Make sure you can quickly access it in an emergency when needed.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use solutions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/endpoint-detection-response-edr\">Kaspersky Endpoint Detection and Response Expert</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/managed-detection-and-response\">Kaspersky Managed Detection and Response</a>&nbsp;service which help to identify and stop the attack on early stages, before attackers reach their final goals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the latest\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence\">Threat Intelligence</a>\u00a0information to stay aware of actual TTPs used by threat actors.

This joint advisory details known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that FBI investigations correlated<strong>\u00a0</strong>with LockBit 3.0 ransomware as recently as March 2023.&#8221; reads the advisory published by US agencies. &#8220;LockBit 3.0 functions as an affiliate-based ransomware variant and is a continuation of LockBit 2.0 and LockBit.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lockbit gang has been active since at least 2019 and today it is one of the most active ransomware groups offering a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The LockBit 3.0 ransomware (aka <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/141666/cyber-crime/lockbit-green-ransomware-variant.html\">LockBit Black</a>) was <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/132701/breaking-news/lockbit-3-0.html\">launched</a> in June 2022 and is a continuation of previous versions of the ransomware, <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/120664/cyber-crime/lockbit-2-0-ransomware-group-policies.html\">LockBit 2.0</a> (released in mid-2021), and <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/134707/cyber-crime/lockbit-hacked-entrust.html\">LockBit</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-36.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Lockbit3.0\" class=\"wp-image-143674\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-36.png?resize=671%2C324&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"671\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The LockBit 3.0 ransomware is a modular malware that is more evasive than its previous versions, its <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/133697/malware/lockbit-3-0-blackmatter-ransomware.html\">shared similarities</a> with <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/123549/cyber-crime/blackmatter-ransomware-joint-advisory.html\">Blackmatter</a> and <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/141409/data-breach/blackcat-ransomware-solar-industries-india.html\">Blackcat</a> ransomware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;LockBit 3.0 is configured upon compilation with many different options that determine the behavior of the ransomware. Upon the actual execution of the ransomware within a victim environment, various arguments can be supplied to further modify the behavior of the ransomware. For example, LockBit 3.0 accepts additional arguments for specific operations in lateral movement and rebooting into Safe Mode (see LockBit Command Line parameters under Indicators of Compromise).&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-075a\">reads the joint alert</a>.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;If a LockBit affiliate does not have access to passwordless LockBit 3.0 ransomware, then a password argument is mandatory during the execution of the ransomware.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By protecting the code with encryption, the latest LockBit version can avoid the detection of signature-based anti-malware solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ransomware doesn&#8217;t infect machines whose language settings are included in an exclusion list, which includes Romanian (Moldova), Arabic (Syria), and Tatar (Russia).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initial attack vectors used by affiliates deploying LockBit 3.0 ransomware include remote desktop protocol (RDP) exploitation, drive-by compromise, phishing campaigns, abuse of valid accounts, and exploitation of public-facing applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon execution in the target network, the ransomware attempts to escalate privileges if they are not sufficient, terminate processes and services, delete logs, files in the recycle bin folder, and shadow copies residing on disk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LockBit 3.0 attempts to perform lateral movement by using a preconfigured list of credentials hardcoded at compilation time or a compromised local account with elevated privileges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operators can also compile LockBit 3.0 for spreading via Group Policy Objects and PsExec using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The RaaS&#8217;s affiliates use the following tools to exfiltrate data before encrypting it:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stealbit, a custom exfiltration tool used previously with LockBit 2.0; </li>\n\n\n\n<li>publicly available file-sharing services, such as MEGA.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The affiliates have been observed using various freeware and open-source tools furing their attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;These tools are used for a range of activities such as network reconnaissance, remote access and tunneling, credential dumping, and file exfiltration. Use of PowerShell and Batch scripts<br />are observed across most intrusions, which focus on system discovery, reconnaissance, password/credential hunting, and privilege escalation. Artifacts of professional penetration-testing tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike have also been observed.&#8221; continues the report.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alert states that LockBit 3.0 is capable of bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to execute code with elevated privileges via elevated Component Object Model (COM) Interface. It also supports a Safe Mode feature to bypass endpoint antivirus and detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alert also provides mitigations and security controls to prevent and reduce the impact of the threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong>\u00a0\u2013</strong> <strong>hacking, RaaS)</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/143668/breaking-news/lockbit-3-0-ransomware-joint-alert.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">US govt agencies released a joint alert on the Lockbit 3.0 ransomware</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Security Affairs</a>.</p>"

While investigating the increased use of Windows Packet Divert (<a href=\"https://github.com/basil00/WinDivert\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WPD</a>) tools by crooks to distribute malware under this pretense, the researchers spotted the campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Threat actors distribute malware in archives with fake installation instructions, urging users to disable security tools to allow their execution. Using this social engineering trick, threats like stealers, RATs, Trojans, and crypto miners can persist undetected. Common malware families include <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/112147/cyber-crime/njrat-rat-pastebin-c2.html\">NJRat</a>, XWorm, <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/157496/hacking/phemedrone-info-stealer-campaign-exploit-cve-2023-36025.html\">Phemedrone</a>, and <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/131122/cyber-crime/dcrat-cheap-rat.html\">DCRat</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The malware campaign is infecting users with a miner disguised as a DPI bypass tool. The attackers modified a popular tool that is available on GitHub. Kaspersky already identified over 2,000 victims in Russia, but the true number may be higher. A YouTuber with 60,000 subscribers unknowingly helped spread the malware, linking to a malicious archive in videos that amassed 400,000 views before the link was removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers used the malicious site gitrok[.]com to distribute an infected archive, which had over 40,000 downloads. They also manipulated YouTubers by falsely claiming copyright strikes, threatening channel shutdowns unless they posted videos with malicious links. A Telegram channel and a popular YouTube account with 340,000 subscribers also spread the malware. By December 2024, reports emerged of further miner-infected versions spreading via Telegram and YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-16.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-175174\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-16.png?resize=1024%2C438&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovered infected archives contained an additional executable, with a modified start script tricking victims into disabling antivirus protections. The first-stage malware is a Python-based loader that was packed with PyInstaller and sometimes obfuscated using PyArmor. It fetched a second-stage payload from hardcoded domains, executing it as <em>t.py</em> in a temporary folder. The payload was only accessible from Russian IPs, suggesting a targeted attack on Russian users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The downloaded\u00a0di.exe\u00a0is a\u00a0<a href=\"https://securelist.com/miner-campaign-misuses-open-source-siem-agent/114022/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SilentCryptoMiner</a>\u00a0sample based on the open-source miner XMRig. This is a covert miner able to mine multiple cryptocurrencies (ETH, ETC, XMR, RTM and others) using various algorithms. For stealth, SilentCryptoMiner employs\u00a0<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">process hollowing</a>\u00a0to inject the miner code into a system process (in this case,\u00a0dwm.exe).&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://securelist.com/silentcryptominer-spreads-through-blackmail-on-youtube/115788/\">report</a> published by Kaspersky. &#8220;The malware is able to stop mining while the processes specified in the configuration are active. It can be controlled remotely via a web panel.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The miner can prevent the execution in a virtualized environment and verify its file size (680-800 MB) to ensure it was executed by the intended loader. Its configuration is Base64-encoded and encrypted with AES-CBC. The miner halts when specific monitoring tools run and fetches updates every 100 minutes. It uses Pastebin to store its configuration, with multiple accounts distributing the malicious files.&#8221; concludes the report. &#8220;The topic of restriction bypass tools is being actively exploited to distribute malware. The above campaign limited itself to distributing a miner, but threat actors could start to use this vector for more complex attacks, including data theft and downloading other malware. This underscores once again that, while such tools may look enticing, they pose a serious threat to user data security.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong>\u00a0\u2013</strong>\u00a0<strong>hacking,\u00a0SilentCryptoMiner)</strong></p>"

December 2022, the above-described commercial online password manager suffered two major data breaches \u2014 one in August 2022 and one in November 2022 \u2014 in which the attackers stole encrypted passwords and the online password manager vault data.&#8221; reads the complaint. &#8220;The Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) has been investigating these data breaches, and law enforcement agents investigating the instant case have spoken with FBI agents about their investigation. From those conversations, law enforcement agents in this case learned that the stolen data and passwords that were stored in several victims\u2019 online password manager accounts were used to illegally, and without authorization, access the victims\u201d electronic accounts and steal information, cryptocurrency, and other data&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators didn&#8217;t name the password manager but noted it suffered major breaches in August and November 2022, which match with the incident suffered by LastPass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators found no evidence of device hacking, supporting the hypothesis that attackers decrypted stolen password manager data to access the victim&#8217;s crypto wallet. The scale and speed of the theft indicate a coordinated effort, consistent with previous breaches of online password managers and crypto thefts. Authorities believe the same hackers behind those attacks were responsible for this incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Working with dozens of victims, security researchers\u00a0<strong>Nick Bax</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Taylor Monahan</strong>\u00a0found that none of the six-figure cyberheist victims appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto theft, such as the compromise of one\u2019s email and/or mobile phone accounts, or SIM-swapping attacks.&#8221; <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/feds-link-150m-cyberheist-to-2022-lastpass-hacks/\">reported</a> KrebsOnSecurity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They discovered the victims all had something else in common: Each had at one point stored their cryptocurrency seed phrase \u2014 the secret code that lets anyone gain access to your cryptocurrency holdings \u2014 in the \u201cSecure Notes\u201d area of their LastPass account prior to the 2022 breaches at the company. Bax and Monahan found another common theme with these robberies: They all followed a similar pattern of cashing out, rapidly moving stolen funds to a dizzying number of drop accounts scattered across various cryptocurrency exchanges.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However. LastPass&#8217;s statement highlights that they are not aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since we initially disclosed this incident back in 2022, LastPass has worked in close cooperation with multiple representatives from law enforcement. To date, our law enforcement partners have not made us aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident.&#8221; reads the statement. &#8220;In the meantime, we have been investing heavily in enhancing our security measures and will continue to do so.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Be honest\u2026 Has your team forgotten LastPass was breached in 2022 which has lead to 9 figures in cryptocurrency thefts?<br /><br />Let\u2019s not forget your team has long covered up the extent of the attack and gaslit many confirmed victims. <br /><br />Now yesterday in a forfeiture complaint even law\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/GFFqZSq3kL\">pic.twitter.com/GFFqZSq3kL</a></p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1898032294507528615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Monahan criticized LastPass for not warning users that stored secrets, especially in &#8220;Secure Notes,&#8221; may be at risk, blaming their inaction for massive financial losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong>\u00a0\u2013</strong>\u00a0<strong>hacking,\u00a0newsletter)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>"

Tarlogic also developed a tool for auditing Bluetooth device security across all operating systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experts warn that a hidden feature poses a security risk for millions of IoT devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Tarlogic Security\u00a0has detected a hidden functionality that can be used as a backdoor in the ESP32, a microcontroller that enables WiFi and Bluetooth connection and is present in\u00a0millions of mass-market IoT devices.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://www.tarlogic.com/news/backdoor-esp32-chip-infect-ot-devices/\">report</a> published by the researchers &#8220;Exploitation of this hidden functionality would allow hostile actors to conduct impersonation attacks and\u00a0permanently infect sensitive devices such as mobile phones, computers, smart locks or medical equipment by\u00a0bypassing code audit controls.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tarlogic researchers used the <a href=\"https://www.tarlogic.com/bsam/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BSAM methodology</strong></a>, introduced last year, to systematically audit Bluetooth device security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;In the course of the investigation, a\u00a0<strong>hidden feature was discovered in the ESP32 chip</strong>, used in millions of IoT devices and which can be purchased on the world\u2019s most famous e-commerce sites for \u20ac2. It is this low cost that explains why it is present in the vast majority of Bluetooth IoT devices for domestic use.&#8221; continues the researchers. &#8220;In 2023, the manufacturer Espressif reported in a statement that one billion units of this chip had been sold worldwide to date.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tarlogic\u2019s Innovation Department created BluetoothUSB, a free driver that allows researchers to conduct comprehensive Bluetooth security audits across all devices, regardless of OS or programming language. This tool eliminates the need for diverse hardware, making security testing more accessible. The researchers pointed out that BluetoothUSB aims to democratize security analysis for millions of IoT devices, helping manufacturers develop tools to test and protect Bluetooth-enabled gadgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers discovered multiple hidden commands using the tool they created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through reverse engineering, Targolic researchers discovered hidden commeds (code 0x3F) in the ESP32 Bluetooth firmware. Inspecting the code, Targolic noticed that the last entry in the table references the code 0x3F that is reserved for proprietary commands. The code contains 29 undocumented HCI commands by ESP.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-15.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-175150\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-15.png?resize=1024%2C507&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-14.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-175147\" height=\"511\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-14.png?resize=1024%2C511&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers demonstrated how a threat actor could fully control ESP32 chips, gain persistence through RAM and Flash modification, and potentially spread to other devices using advanced Bluetooth attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;We would like to clarify that it is more appropriate to refer to the presence of proprietary HCI commands\u2014which allow operations such as reading and modifying memory in the ESP32 controller\u2014as a \u201c<strong>hidden feature</strong>\u201d rather than a \u201c<strong>backdoor</strong>.\u201d concludes the report. &#8220;The use of these commands could facilitate supply chain attacks, the concealment of backdoors in the chipset, or the execution of more sophisticated attacks.

The ransomware group used an unsecured webcam to encrypt systems within a\u00a0target&#8217;s network, bypassing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers observed that the <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/150157/cyber-crime/cisco-asa-ransomware-attacks.html\">Akira ransomware</a> was initially blocked by the EDR installed on the victim&#8217;s systems, which identified and quarantined the ransomware binary, preventing its deployment across the victim&#8217;s network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Akira ransomware group gained access to the network via a remote access tool, using AnyDesk for persistence and exfiltrating data. The attacker then moved via RDP to a server and attempted to deploy ransomware as a password-protected zip file, but the victim\u2019s EDR tool blocked it. Realizing EDR was active, they pivoted by scanning the network for vulnerable devices. They found unsecured IoT devices, including webcams and a fingerprint scanner, using them to bypass security defenses and successfully deploy the ransomware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attacker exploited a webcam affected by critical vulnerabilities, including remote shell access and no EDR protection. The IoT device was running a lightweight Linux OS, that was the perfect target for Akira\u2019s Linux ransomware variant. The lack of monitoring allowed the attacker to deploy ransomware, unnoticed by the victim\u2019s security team, who failed to detect suspicious SMB traffic. Akira successfully encrypted files across the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;After identifying the webcam as a suitable target, the threat actor began deploying their Linux-based ransomware with little delay. As the device was not being monitored, the victim organisation&#8217;s security team were unaware of the increase in malicious Server Message Block (SMB) traffic from the webcam to the impacted server, which otherwise may have alerted them.<a href=\"https://www.s-rminform.com/latest-thinking/camera-off-akira-deploys-ransomware-via-webcam#_ftn1\">[1]</a>\u00a0Akira was subsequently able to encrypt files across the victim\u2019s network.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://www.s-rminform.com/latest-thinking/camera-off-akira-deploys-ransomware-via-webcam\"><strong>report</strong></a> published by the S-RM team.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-12.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"akira ransomware edr bypass\" class=\"wp-image-175107\" height=\"605\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-12.png?resize=1024%2C605&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Akira ransomware attack reveals the risks of overlooked IoT devices, evolving cyber threats, and EDR limitations. Weak links like unpatched IoT devices can be exploited, as seen with Akira\u2019s shift from Rust to C++ for broader attacks. Despite EDR\u2019s importance, gaps in coverage or misconfigurations allow attackers to bypass defenses, emphasizing the need for comprehensive security strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Preventing and remediating novel attacks like this one can be challenging. At a minimum, organisations should monitor network traffic from their IoT devices and detect anomalies.&#8221; concludes the report. &#8220;They should also consider adopting the following security practices:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Turn devices off:\u00a0</strong>Keep IoT devices switched off when they are not in use.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Network restriction or segmentation:\u00a0</strong>Place IoT devices on a segmented network that cannot be accessed from servers or user workstations or restrict the devices\u2019 communication with specific ports and IP addresses.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Internal network audit:\u00a0</strong>Regularly audit devices connected to the internal network, which may help to identify security weaknesses or rogue devices implemented by a threat actor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Patch and device management:\u00a0</strong>Keep devices, including IoT devices, regularly patched with the most recent update. Ensure default passwords of IoT devices are changed to unique and complex ones.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/148007/cyber-crime/akira-ransomware-decryptor.html\">Akira ransomware</a>\u00a0has been active since March 2023, the threat actors behind the malware claim to have already hacked multiple organizations in multiple industries, including education, finance, and real estate. Like other ransomware gangs, the group has\u00a0developed a Linux encryptor\u00a0to target VMware ESXi servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong>\u00a0\u2013</strong>\u00a0<strong>hacking,\u00a0Akira ransomware)</strong></p>"

Traditional anonymization techniques, such as pseudonymization and k-anonymity, have proven inadequate against sophisticated re-identification attacks. A robust privacy-preserving mechanism called differential privacy (DP) introduces mathematically guaranteed noise to dataset queries while maintaining statistical utility. This article uses differential privacy in healthcare, finance, and government data analytics to explore the mathematical foundation, implementation strategies, and real-world applications of differential privacy. A comparative analysis with other privacy techniques demonstrates differential privacy&#8217;s superior protection. Rising privacy concerns with Artificial Intelligence have paved the way for secure, ethical, and efficient data analysis. Using AI, organizations increasingly rely on data analytics to extract context from vast amounts of information. Concerns over privacy breaches require robust mechanisms to safeguard sensitive user data. Traditional methods of anonymizing data, such as masking and pseudonymization, have been proven inadequate in preventing re-identification attacks. Data privacy has been enhanced by differential privacy (DP), which preserves analytical utility while protecting data privacy. Differential privacy ensures that statistical queries performed on a dataset do not compromise individual privacy, even when an adversary possesses auxiliary knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cornerstone in privacy-preserving data analytics introduced the concept of differential privacy, its mathematical basis, and how adding noise ensures privacy. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-5906-5_752\">Cynthia Dwork (2006)</a> introduced the fundamental idea, established its mathematical basis, and illustrated how privacy guarantees can be attained by adding numerical work. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-5906-5_752\">Cynthia Dwork (2006)</a> introduced the concept of differential privacy, establishing its mathematical foundation and demonstrating how adding noise can achieve privacy guarantees. Their research remains a cornerstone in the field of privacy-preserving data analytics. Their work continues to be a cornerstone in privacy-preserving data analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recent research has focused on applying differential privacy in various domains. According to <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2660267.2660348\">Erlingsson (2014),</a> Google&#8217;s RAPPOR system collects user data while maintaining anonymity. Similarly, <a href=\"https://ecommons.cornell.edu/items/34684ca6-7ae0-4875-bdac-bcf03674158c\">Abowd(2018)</a> examined its integration with a census data collection framework, ensuring confidentiality. Despite its advantages, challenges like keeping data utility and optimizing privacy budgets persist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Concepts of Differential Privacy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Definition and Mathematical Foundation</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Differential privacy is mathematically defined using the (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differential privacy model, where \u03b5 (epsilon) controls privacy loss and \u03b4 (delta) represents the probability of breaking privacy. A mechanism M satisfies \u03b5-differential privacy if:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud835\udc43[\ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc37) \u2208 S] \u2264 \ud835\udc52<sup>\u2208</sup> \u2219 \ud835\udc43[\ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc37<sup>\u2032</sup>) \u2208 S</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any two datasets, D and D differ by a single record. As a result, an individual&#8217;s data does not significantly affect query results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Noise Addition Mechanisms</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several techniques implement differential privacy by adding calibrated noise:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Laplace Mechanism: Uses Laplace distribution noise for numerical queries.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gaussian Mechanism: Enhances privacy using Gaussian noise in specified settings</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Exponential Mechanism: It selects optimal outputs with differential privacy guarantees for non-numeric data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Application of Differential Privacy in AI</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Differential Privacy in Healthcare AI</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthcare institutions process sensitive patient data, making electronic health records (EHRs) private to enable statistical research while safeguarding patient confidentiality. Studies have shown that using the Laplace mechanism in medical datasets can prevent data leakage without significantly distorting analysis results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Differential privacy in Finance AI</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial institutions use AI-driven data for fraud detection, segmentation, and risk assessment. Differential privacy can protect individual records from unauthorized access. For instance, banks that implement differential privacy in customer transaction datasets ensure that no single transaction can be traced back to an individual, thereby reducing risks associated with financial breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comparison of Differential Privacy with Other Privacy Techniques</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Privacy Method</strong></td><td><strong>Definition</strong></td><td><strong>Strengths</strong></td><td><strong>Weaknesses</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pseudonymization</strong></td><td>Replacing identifiers with fake values</td><td>Simple, widely used</td><td>Vulnerable to re-identification</td></tr><tr><td><strong>k-Anonymity</strong></td><td>Generalizing data to hide individuals</td><td>Effective for structured datasets</td><td>Fails under linkage attacks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Differential Privacy</strong></td><td>Adding statistical noise to queries</td><td>Strong privacy guarantees</td><td>High noise levels reduce utility</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the table above, differential privacy offers better privacy guarantees than pseudonymization and k-anonymity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges and Future Directions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite differential privacy&#8217;s power to protect sensitive data, it faces several challenges that make it difficult for it to be widely adopted. One of the primary difficulties is determining an optimal privacy budget (\u03b5). The \u03b5 value controls the trade-off between privacy and data utility, but selecting an appropriate value remains complex. Noise addition also diminishes data utility. Because of differential privacy, individual data points cannot be precisely identified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research and potential improvements are emerging. Future advancements in privacy-preserving machine learning and adaptive differential privacy models are expected further to enhance the security and effectiveness of big data analytics. Differential privacy is rapidly advancing, with differentially private federated learning already implemented by Google and Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individual records are indistinguishable, and controlled noise is used to prevent privacy breaches. Data protection in healthcare, finance, and government requires differential privacy rather than pseudonymization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data privacy-utility trade-offs, determining an optimal privacy budget, and developing noise mechanisms remain key challenges. Research on adaptive noise mechanisms and federated learning makes differential privacy more efficient and practical. As AI privacy concerns grow, differential privacy will be crucial to ensuring secure and ethical data analytics. Research and technological advancements will help refine differential privacy techniques to use AI to balance data security and analytical effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the author: Arfi Siddik Mollashaik, Solution Architect at Securiti.ai, USA</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arfi Siddik Mollashaik is a Solution Architect at Securiti.ai, USA, a leading enterprise data security, privacy, and compliance firm.
