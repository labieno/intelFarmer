However, it's important to distinguish between actual threats and potential risks. Organizations need a durable advantage to identify and classify these challenges, and Intelligence plays a crucial role in evaluating risks and determining the appropriate response. </p><p>In business, the distinction between threats and risks may be clear, but in my experience, there is nuance in the analysis and final classification.  </p><p>To simplify the path from intelligence to risk (I2R), in the summer of 2022, my Recorded Future colleagues (Dylan Davis, David Carver, and Harry Matias) and I sat down with a whiteboard to formalize our process. The below pyramid is how we think about identifying, managing, and communicating risks.</p><p><img alt=\"introducing-intelligence-risk-pyramid-fig-1.jpg\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/introducing_intelligence_risk_pyramid_fig_1_2d7f4a20d0.jpg\" /></p><p>Connecting intelligence to risk and executive relevance is not straightforward. One of the biggest challenges businesses face is complexity. With so much information available, it can be difficult to determine what is relevant and what is not. This complexity can lead to the shadow of executive irrelevance, where leaders cannot make sense of the information they have and make informed decisions.</p><p>To overcome this complexity, businesses need broad visibility across different events. This is what Recorded Future's President, Stu Solomon, calls Foundational Intelligence. It's a process of gathering and analyzing data from multiple sources to comprehensively understand the current environment. By understanding the different types of events that are happening and how they are related, businesses can better evaluate the risks they face.</p><p>The next step in the process is threat implication. This is where analysts earn their paychecks. The skill of identifying non-obvious and perhaps non-intuitive implications is what sets good analysts apart from great ones. It can be mentally taxing, but the results are valuable. A broad background in geopolitics and cyber, as well as knowledge of current events, is a prerequisite for identifying threat implications. This step is where an answer takes shape for the two fundamental executive questions: &quot;So what?&quot; and &quot;Now what?&quot;</p><p>Control validation is the next step, where businesses determine if their controls are working as intended. When threats become technical, such as new malicious code, it's often discovered that controls are not functioning properly. This stage moves a threat from general thesis applicability to the exposure of a potential control gap or the reaffirmation that controls are functioning well. To properly understand internal controls, multiple individuals from across an organization are often required to provide input.</p><p>The &quot;Recommendations&quot; step is necessary for leadership to consider options, each presenting different risks. Ideally, this step produces one strong short-term and long-term recommendation coupled with a business justification that includes resource trade-offs. The next step is &quot;Upside and Downside Risk.&quot;, which involves articulating residual risk from the preceding recommendations. Most enterprises prefer to qualify risk using the likelihood of occurrence and impact paradigm. Once the downside risk is measured (however imprecisely), upside risk is a crucial counterbalance thats often overlooked.</p><p>Finally, the Action pinnacle is when a business leader or leadership team decides to act, or not act (which is also a valid outcome) based on an articulation of the I2R steps and an understanding of current business focus and constraints. </p><p>Our desire is for this framework to bridge the communication gap between security practitioners and executives. Connecting intelligence to risk for an executive audience is a challenging process. We think this is a practical tool to help the worlds intelligence professionals and business leaders. </p><p><a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/i2r-framework.pdf\">Download the whitepaper</a> to learn more about the I2R framework and examples.</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "On Ukraine, China Prioritizes Its International Ambitions", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "On Ukraine, China Prioritizes Its International Ambitions"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/on-ukraine-china-prioritizes-international-ambitions"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2023_0306_Blog_Intelligence_Report_Main_Feature_a568b8bc4d.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/on-ukraine-china-prioritizes-international-ambitions", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/on-ukraine-china-prioritizes-international-ambitions", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 08 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2023, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 67, 0], "summary": "New Insikt Group research evaluates China\u2019s position on the war in Ukraine, including its international interests, and support for Russia.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "New Insikt Group research evaluates China\u2019s position on the war in Ukraine, including its international interests, and support for Russia."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<p><img alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" /></p><p><em>Editors Note: This is an excerpt of a full report.

Information about the author, Devin Thorne, can be found at the end of the report.</em></p><h2 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h2><p>Recently renewed allegations that China is considering providing lethal aid to Russia contrast starkly with Beijings calls for peace and continued assertions that it is <a href=\"https://archive.ph/j3aDG\">objective and just</a> regarding the war in Ukraine. Based on a review of Chinas perspective on the war and what its leaders likely hope to achieve, Insikt Group judges that relations between China and the United States and Europe will almost certainly remain at odds for the duration of the war. Although Chinas position suggests there are areas of potential collaboration on peace, Beijing is likely pursuing a strategy of using a peace settlement to shape how future international crises are addressed, which contains elements that are almost certainly unacceptable to the US and others.</p><p>Chinas leadership almost certainly supports Russia  politically, rhetorically, and by allowing trade in dual-use goods to continue  to further its own strategic agenda, specifically the preservation of an important partner in the creation of a more multilateral international system. Chinas leadership very likely wants a peaceful end to the war. However, Chinas leadership very likely does not support a peace deal that conforms to, and returns to the status quo of, the current international system as led by the US and legitimizes coercive Western measures used against Russia (namely, sanctions) that could be levied against China in the future (such as in a Taiwan scenario).</p><p>Despite its support for Russias position, it is unlikely that Chinas leadership will approve the export of lethal aid to Russia. Such a decision will likely be judged too costly in light of other goals, such as stabilizing relations with the US and Europe and avoiding sanctions. The decision to provide lethal aid likely hinges on whether Chinas leadership judges that, in the short-to-mid term, stable (if not good) relations with the US and Europe are necessary. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinpings personal relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin also has the potential to <a href=\"https://www.chinatalk.media/p/will-xi-arm-putin-has-a-cold-war\">inform</a> how he weighs the available options. Chinas leadership has likely not yet made a decision to provide lethal aid, and as of this writing, has not (based on publicly available information) exported lethal aid to Russia. If Chinas leadership does decide to export lethal aid to Russia, the US and European response will very likely lead to a serious deterioration in relations with China for the foreseeable future.</p><h2 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h2><ul><li>Chinas leadership almost certainly supports Russia politically, rhetorically, and by allowing trade in dual-use goods to further its own strategic agenda. </li><li>Chinas leadership very likely seeks a peaceful solution to the war, but not at the expense of its vision for how the international order should address future crises.</li><li>It is unlikely that Chinas leadership will allow Chinese companies to provide to Russia what the US and Europe deem lethal aid.</li><li>If Chinas leadership decides to export lethal aid to Russia, the US and Europe will almost certainly impose consequences that would very likely lead to a serious deterioration in relations with China for the foreseeable future.</li></ul>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Research (Insikt)", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "2022 Annual Report", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "2022 Annual Report"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-annual-report"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_annual_report_333c48e442.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-annual-report", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-annual-report", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2023, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 61, 0], "summary": "New Insikt research analyzes cyber threat and geopolitical trends observed throughout 2022 and provides a comprehensive overview of the cyber threat landscape.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "New Insikt research analyzes cyber threat and geopolitical trends observed throughout 2022 and provides a comprehensive overview of the cyber threat landscape."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<p><img alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" /></p><p><em>Editors Note: This is an excerpt of a full report.

We analyze global trends and evaluate significant cybersecurity events, geopolitical developments, vulnerability disclosures, and more, providing a broad, holistic view of the cyber threat landscape in 2022.</em></p><h2 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h2><p>The physical conflict in Ukraine, and the effects it has had on the cyber threat landscape throughout 2022, frames our discussion of significant cyber threat events and geopolitical trends that occurred in 2022 and underscores the increased convergence of the cyber and geopolitical threat landscape.</p><p>Before and throughout the physical invasion, Recorded Future has observed increased instances of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, hacktivist activity, and the widespread deployment of wiper malware. And while Russias invasion of Ukraine dominated the discussion of kinetic and cyber-hybrid operations, threat actors affiliated with other prominent nation-states, specifically Iran, China, and North Korea, carried out cyberattacks throughout the year, informed by an era of heightened geopolitical tension, competition, and politically charged affiliations. </p><p>We also analyzed cyber threat events across the broader threat landscape, including those carried out by cybercriminal groups. While phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks continue to plague organizations across industries and geographies, Recorded Future identified a 600% increase in the number of credentials sold via information stealing malware between Q1 and Q4, a significant year-over-year increase in targeting of software frequently used in organizations supply chains, and a shift toward an increasingly managed service model as as-a-service offerings proliferated on dark web marketplaces and underground forums. Initial access brokers are increasingly active, likely due to the increased use of infostealer malware and the ability to monetize stolen data.</p><p>The effective use of infostealers often relies on the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities. Notable vulnerability-related trends in 2022 included ransomware and Chinese state-sponsored threat actors rapidly exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, the ongoing exploitation of Log4Shell across all quarters in 2022, and the impact of Microsofts oscillation about the automatic disablement of macros.</p><p>Finally, ransomware remained an ever-present threat in 2022. While certain ransomware gangs disbanded, others were quick to assert their dominance and used their significant resources to undertake campaigns against organizations of all sizes across industries. Although ransomware payments decreased by about 60% between 2021 and 2022, likely due to increased guidance from governments to forgo making ransomware payments and increased due diligence on cybersecurity standards from insurance companies when underwriting policies for ransomware attacks, ransomware will continue to pose a major threat to organizations throughout 2023.</p><h2 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li>Self-proclaimed hacktivist activity, likely a mix of grassroots and state-sponsored activity, surged in the first half of the year, as threat actors groups carried out attacks based on their allegiance to either Russia or Ukraine. While the majority of this activity was limited to targeting organizations involved in the conflict or located in areas close to eastern Europe, some hacktivist activity involved organizations in other regions. </li><li>Spillover effects of the deployment of wiper malware and the hacktivist activity were the primary cyber threats to organizations not directly involved in the war in Ukraine. </li><li>North Korea will most likely continue to test ballistic missiles in 2023. US military buildup in the western Pacific and increased defense spending and preparedness measures in Japan are likely to be met with equivalent actions by China. </li><li>Diplomatic negotiations over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA; commonly referred to as the Iran nuclear deal) are unlikely to make any progress. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to enrich uranium in an effort to achieve a nuclear weapon. The Israeli government is likely to continue kinetic strikes on elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) operating in Syria while keeping its options open for strikes on nuclear facilities inside of Iran.</li><li>2022 was the year of as-a-service, as we identified the presence of new phishing-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings in the threat landscape, the continued success of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, and the development and use of new strains of malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings.</li><li>Open source or proprietary software packages were targeted throughout 2022. Given their effectiveness over the past year, these types of attacks will likely grow in severity in 2023. </li><li>Infostealers were increasingly used by threat actors, and the increased advertisement of authentication information collected by infostealers poses a risk to multi-factor authentication (MFA) security solutions. </li><li>While the adoption of countermeasures such as the disablement of macros by default has been highly effective, many threat actors have also pivoted their operations to subvert newly developed or implemented security protections, underscoring the need for a implementation of a defense-in-depth security strategy.</li><li>The exploitation of widely used products, as well as continued exploitation of previously reported vulnerabilities like Log4Shell, underscores threat actors ongoing focus on attack vectors that can be used for extended periods of time.</li><li>The volume of ransomware attacks is unlikely to shrink in 2023. However, if the finance gain from ransomware attacks continues to decrease, as observed from 2021 to 2022, threat actors are likely to adjust their tactics to continue realizing the historical financial incentives for ransomware attacks.</li></ul>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Research (Insikt)", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "CVE-2022-39952: Pre-authentication Code-execution Vulnerability", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "CVE-2022-39952: Pre-authentication Code-execution Vulnerability"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/cve-2022-39952-fortinet-fortinac-pre-authentication-code-execution-vuln"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/CVE_2022_39952_Main_d933fe0c01.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/cve-2022-39952-fortinet-fortinac-pre-authentication-code-execution-vuln", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/cve-2022-39952-fortinet-fortinac-pre-authentication-code-execution-vuln", "guidislink": false, "published": "Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2023, 2, 28, 0, 0, 0, 1, 59, 0], "summary": "In this blog post, we delve into the critical vulnerability CVE-2022-39952 found in Fortinet FortiNAC, the implications of this vulnerability, the potential impact on affected systems, and how to mitigate the risks of this exploit.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "In this blog post, we delve into the critical vulnerability CVE-2022-39952 found in Fortinet FortiNAC, the implications of this vulnerability, the potential impact on affected systems, and how to mitigate the risks of this exploit."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<h2 id=\"cve-2022-39952-fortinet-fortinac-pre-authentication-code-execution-vulnerability\">CVE-2022-39952: Fortinet FortiNAC Pre-authentication Code-execution Vulnerability</h2><p>Fortinet has discovered a vulnerability in the FortiNAC web server which allows unauthenticated arbitrary file access.

Russias <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/12/19/what-russian-invasion-reveals-about-future-of-cyber-warfare-pub-88667\">offensive cyber operations</a> have been unable to substantively augment Russias conventional military progress and will likely shift to targeting civilian infrastructure in an attempt to degrade Ukraines morale ahead of an upcoming, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64492938\">renewed</a> offensive. Russias continued reliance on leveraging proxy groups to achieve its objectives in Ukraine while maintaining plausible deniability has further illuminated the links between Russian Intelligence Services (RIS) and non-state actors, evidenced by Russias direct, indirect, and tacit relationships with cybercriminal and hacktivist groups as outlined in our report, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine\">Dark Covenant 2.0: Cybercrime, the Russian State, and the War in Ukraine</a>. </p><p>The so-called brotherhood of <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137021946_3\">Russian-speaking threat actors</a> located in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has been damaged as a result of political disagreements among threat actors in the context of the war.

Regardless of frauds reputation as an unsophisticated form of cybercrime, it is likely becoming less a crime of opportunity than of survival. International arrests, seizures, and disruptive actions have destabilized the business model associated with commodified cybercrime, leading to wide-ranging and rippling effects on the malware- and ransomware-as-a-service (MaaS, RaaS) threat landscapes. These disruptions have also spread to the dark web shop and marketplace ecosystems, leading to price fluctuations and newfound competition among market administrators. Cybercrime, both based in the CIS and globally, is entering into a new era of volatility as a result of Russias war against Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li>We did not identify any direct links between credential leaks preceding Russias war against Ukraine; however, we believe that these credential leaks could have been leveraged by threat actors seeking to exploit geopolitical tensions prior to the war. We also note that some of the database breaches we identified have since been attributed to nation-state actors.</li><li>The so-called brotherhood of Russian-speaking threat actors located in the CIS has been damaged by insider leaks and group splintering, due to declarations of nation-state allegiance both in support of and opposed to Russias war against Ukraine.</li><li>Russia is experiencing a wave of IT brain drain that will likely decentralize the organized cybercriminal threat landscape. In addition to brain drain, waves of military mobilization of Russias citizens are resulting in decreased activity on Russian-language dark web and special-access forums.</li><li>The resurgence of crowdsourced hacktivism will likely create a new generation of non-state threat actors. The impact of hacktivism has been limited, but its role in enabling information operations (IOs) remains vital. Hacktivism has become symbolic in the publics perception of the cyberwar raging parallel to Russias war against Ukraine.</li><li>Russian law enforcements seizure and closure of several top-tier carding shops in January and February 2022 severely disrupted the payment card fraud ecosystem until April 2022. Since May 2022, the emergence of new carding shops has driven a partial rebound in the volume of compromised card-not-present (CNP) data posted for sale on the dark web.</li><li>International arrests, seizures, and disruptive actions have destabilized the business model associated with commodified cybercrime. </li><li>Russias war against Ukraine has disrupted the dark web shop and marketplace ecosystems. International supply-chain disruptions and border closures have made the shipping of physical contraband impractical for Russia-based threat actors.</li></ul><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><p>On February 24, 2022, Russia <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/leaders-key-quotes-after-russia-invades-ukraine-2022-02-24/\">began</a> a full-scale invasion of Ukraine that was supported by ground and aerial bombardment, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, cyberattacks, electronic warfare, information warfare, and more. Almost immediately, the Russian cybercriminal underground reacted with <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-110a\">declarations of allegiance</a> from forum administrators, threat actors, and threat actor organizations. Hacktivist campaigns, coordinated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, doxxing activities, trolling, website defacement, ransomware infections, and more began within hours of the invasion.</p><p>While the vast majority of non-state cybercriminal and hacktivist activities in the early days of Russias war against Ukraine targeted Russian and Belarusian entities in retaliation for the invasion, opportunistic threat actors sought to exploit the tensions by leveraging vulnerabilities in the cyber infrastructure of Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian entities and selling leaked information or unauthorized access for financial gain and publicity. Declarations of allegiance also prompted internal unrest within certain threat actor organizations, leading to hostile activities and schisms between threat actors. </p><p>Since February 24, 2022, we have been actively monitoring the daily activities of cybercriminal and non-state hacktivist entities that have been involved directly or indirectly in the Russian war against Ukraine.</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Research (Insikt)", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Black History Month: ERG Employee Stories, Impact, Community & Celebration", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Black History Month: ERG Employee Stories, Impact, Community & Celebration"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/erg-stories-black-history-month-2023"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/black_history_month_2023_main_b63ff9d711.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/erg-stories-black-history-month-2023", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/erg-stories-black-history-month-2023", "guidislink": false, "published": "Tue, 14 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2023, 2, 14, 0, 0, 0, 1, 45, 0], "summary": "Celebrate Black History Month with us as we hear from members of our Black Empowerment and Support Team.

Ive lived in Milan for the past 30 years, but Im originally from Ghana. Im a very curious person and Id like to try anything at least once. I have a great passion for all types of music, I play 3 instruments and produce. </p><p>Max has been at Recorded Future for 6 months. He joined as a Customer Success Manager within our Intelligence Services team. When our recruiting team reached out, Max had been looking to transition into the Cyber Intelligence space and was eager to join a more dynamic environment. </p><p><em>It was perfect timing. So, when given the opportunity, I seized it.</em></p><p>As a CSM for the EMEA region, Max is a trusted advisor for Recorded Futures clients. He ensures that clients make the most of our platform. In this consultative role, his focus is on building trust, loyalty, and long-term satisfaction.</p><p><u>Carlton:</u> My name is Carlton but I often go by my callsign from my Navy career<em>MEL</em>. I am 55 years old and I came to Recorded Future after a long career in the Navy both in uniform and as a government civilian. Ive been married for more than 28 years and my wife Beth and I have two children, Ethan and Jada, and a dog Baxter.</p><p>Carlton is a Senior Manager on the Public Sector, Intelligence Services Team and just celebrated his one-year anniversary at Recorded Future. Carlton first heard of Recorded Future about seven years ago. He was running the Navys drug interdiction support program who were always looking for open source capabilities. </p><p><em>I knew then that Recorded Future was a quality company that offered a tremendous opportunity for the Intelligence Community to exploit publicly available information in a much more meaningful way.</em></p><p>Carlton is on one hand responsible for his teams overall performance and on the other acts as a program manager which entails more direct interaction with our clients optimizing the customer experience. </p><h2 id=\"what-its-like-working-at-recorded-future-for-you\">What Its Like Working at Recorded Future For You</h2><p><u>Maxwell:</u> What I love the most is being surrounded by a lot of talented and smart people that take their responsibilities very seriously, but at the same time everyone Ive met, is super friendly and willing to help each other. Futurists understand that diversity isnt something that needs to be acknowledged and respected theoretically, but also practically: being committed to our values through concrete actions. ERGs create safe spaces for their members while helping them become the best version of themselves.</p><p><u>Carlton:</u> Early on, I noticed that Recorded Future not only talks the talk but also works to walk the walk. When I discuss Recorded Future two themes always come up: that the company and its people are incredibly accepting and that there is this constant pursuit of improvement for themselves and others. There is a real propensity to try to lift up those around you. Im proud to work for a company that seeks to live by its principles. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/company-values-our-guiding-principles\">Read: Setting The Scene - Company Values, Our Guiding Principles</a></p><p>Side by side with our other ERGs (OUT@RF, Women@RF, Veterans@RF, Ohana, RFs Latin Network) and global culture group, B.E.S.T. helps foster an environment where employees can thrive and be themselves.

Specifically, Id like to dive more into what blackness means in different parts of the world, in the professional space, and understand how it can be a shared experience even for people that have different nationalities, views and experiences.</p><p><em>Carlton:</em> I think that we all have a need to connect to our past and understand that those that came before us made it possible for us to live with the privileges that we have today. We live in an imperfect world but its important to understand that so many have worked hard and sacrificed to create progress. Within the ERG, my hope is that we can build on that foundation and carry the torch forward, continuing to build the great sense of community I experienced</p><h2 id=\"why-get-involved-in-best--ergs\">Why Get Involved in B.E.S.T. / ERGs</h2><p><em>Maxwell:</em> I think its important to connect with colleagues on levels that are not solely professional.

Between 2021 and 2022 we observed an approximately 3-fold increase in ransomware targeting <a href=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2022/09/esxi-targeting-ransomware-the-threats-that-are-after-your-virtual-machines-part-1.html\">ESXi</a>, with offerings available from many groups including ALPHV, LockBit, and BlackBasta. We identified and described detection strategies for multiple TTPs that are often seen prior to the dropping of the ransomware payload in order to create detections and mitigations that are based on real-world, threat-actor use of these tools. In addition to providing tool-specific detections such as YARA and Sigma rules, we also identified detections for common enumeration, exploitation, and persistence techniques. The detections and mitigations provided can be used not only for the tools assessed below but also for custom (threat actor-specific) tools that are outside the scope of this report. Organizations looking to threat hunt, detect, and mitigate pre-ransomware TTPs for ESXi systems should use the detections provided as a starting point to develop detections specific to their environment and as part of a layered security approach. The infancy of defensive products such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus software (AV) currently available for ESXi, combined with organizations increased reliance on virtualization, creates an attractive target for threat actors and can potentially lead to operational downtime and reputational damage to an organization.</p><h2 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li>Ransomware targeting ESXi will continue to be a threat to organizations, putting them at risk of operational downtime, competitive disadvantage, and damage to their brand. </li><li>Organizations should continue to deploy virtualized infrastructure, but it is critical to implement security best practices and similar precautions as used in existing infrastructure.</li><li>The malicious tools targeting ESXi primarily abuse native commands to perform their actions, making them difficult to differentiate from normal system administrator activity.</li><li>Openly available tools and device search engines will continue to be used by threat actors targeting ESXi, in addition to custom tooling.</li><li>The immaturity of antivirus and EDR solutions that cover ESXi, coupled with the difficulty of implementing security measures, lowers the technical barrier for threat actors deploying malware on ESXi compared with those targeting Windows.</li><li>Exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access is a common tactic; however, many threat actors simply rely on system administrator notes, stored passwords, or keylogging specific employees to gain access to a vSphere environment.</li><li>Defensive practices are difficult to implement due to the complex nature of hypervisors; however, implementing utilities that provide host attestation, reduce the attack surface, and minimize access to other systems on the network can greatly reduce risk for organizations.</li></ul><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><p>Ransomware groups continue to evolve and expand their toolsets, focusing on more specialized targets and creating more refined tooling based on opportunities to make money. VMware ESXi is the market-leading, enterprise-grade hypervisor designed for deploying and serving virtual infrastructure. ESXi-targeting ransomware will continue to present a threat to organizations that are shifting towards virtualizing the majority of their server infrastructure. The practice of securing virtualized infrastructure is complicated due to the proprietary nature of the technology and the relative infancy of defensive products designed for it. As a result of these factors, ESXi presents an exceptionally attractive target for financially motivated threat actors.</p><p>In 2020, there were very few mentions of ESXi ransomware attacks, as threat actors primarily targeted Windows-based networks due to the availability of initial access presented by the pandemic and multiple critical vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2019-11510, and CVE-2019-19781). As organizations responded with more effective defenses against ransomware and threat actors recognized the defensive gaps in virtualized networks, threat actors began to create ESXi-specific ransomware and techniques. In 2021, cyberattacks involving ESXi ransomware increased. During 2022, we observed a 3-fold year-over-year increase in ransomware attacks by a larger number of ransomware groups and advanced TTPs and tooling targeting virtualized infrastructure, as seen in Figure 1 below.</p><p><img alt=\"esxi-001.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/esxi_001_ae27d0ad3c.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Ransomware attacks focused on ESXi show a 3-fold increase in a single year (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p><em>Editors Note: This is an excerpt of a full report.

Despite these challenges, the Kremlins intent remains unchanged, leaving Ukraine and the international community at heightened risk. In anticipation of Russias <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64492938\">planned</a> renewed offensive, this report reflects on Russias key hybrid warfare themes over the past year, including military failures, exploitation of natural resources, reliance on proxy groups, and partnerships with anti-Western allies. By doing so, this report illuminates the Kremlins strategic miscalculations and its strategies for overcoming its shortfalls.</p><p>In the near term, Russia will very likely launch a renewed offensive in Ukraine with a likely focus on the Donbas. Russian state-sponsored cyber threat actors, as well as pro-Russian cybercriminals and hacktivists, will almost certainly support this campaign through continued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/31/russian-missiles-kyiv-ukraine-cities\">targeting</a> of Ukrainian critical infrastructure, at least in part in an attempt to further degrade Ukraines morale and will to fight. Meanwhile, Russia will also have to manage the direction of largely <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/16/world/europe/russia-draft-ukraine.html\">untrained troops</a> and modern <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/russia-resorting-soviet-era-anti-aircraft-missiles-hit-land-targets-1723247\">weapons shortages</a>, with likely reliance on recently mobilized troops, proxy organizations like Wagner, and foreign weapon supplies from Iran and North Korea to augment its capabilities.</p><p>In the longer term, Russias actions over the past year have caused lasting geopolitical shifts far beyond Ukraine.

A security rating or monthly report wont notify you of real-time threats, and they certainly wont stop a breach from happening. </p><p>How do we identify these threats in a timely manner? One approach is to employ intelligence. Third-party intelligence continuously monitors key data sources for signs that your suppliers have been compromised (even before they realize it) or may be attacked in the near future. By providing comprehensive visibility into the wider threat landscape, third-party intelligence allows you to stay ahead of new threats. This enables you to accurately assess risk posed by your vendors and keep assessments current as conditions change and new threats emerge.</p><p><strong>Learn How To Build A Threat-Focused Supply Chain Risk Program</strong><br />Rethinking how we manage vendor risk is easier said than done.

According to VMware, this service is disabled by default on new installations since ESXi 7.0 U2c and ESXi 8.0 GA.</p><p>It should be noted that CVE-2021-21974 is not yet officially confirmed as the attack vector. The French CERT lists CVE-2020-3992 as another possibility, which is also a vulnerability of OpenSLP. While the exact vulnerability is unknown, OVHcloud, a large hoster with ESXi servers in its portfolio, confirmed that the OpenSLP service is the point of entry used in this campaign.

As an additional measure, the OpenSLP service can be disabled. The procedure for this is described in <a href=\"https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/76372\">this document</a>.</p><p>Current insights by OVH and the security community suggest that closing port 427 or restricting access to it might also mitigate this vulnerability as a stop-gap measure.</p><p>Infected systems will have the following files present in the /tmp folder, which can serve as an indicator of compromise:</p><ul><li>encrypt</li><li>encrypt .sh </li><li>public.pem</li></ul><p>The systems motd (message of the day) file and index.html will be replaced with a ransom note after the encryption process.

But according to OVHcloud, stopping the VMs often fails, which leaves the files locked and prevents any encryption. Even if the encryption succeeds, only small chunks of the files are encrypted, which makes a recovery theoretically possible. However, this process is quite difficult, and security analysts are still working on the best procedures. The current procedure is described in this <a href=\"https://enes.dev/\">blog post</a>. </p><p>Additionally, CISA and the FBI have released an <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2023/02/08/cisa-and-fbi-release-esxiargs-ransomware-recovery-guidance\">ESXiArgs Ransomware Recovery Guidance</a>, including a specific <a href=\"https://github.com/cisagov/ESXiArgs-Recover\">recovery script</a> for this type of ransomware attack. We encourage all affected organizations to follow this recovery guidance.</p><h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2><p>VMware identified a new ransomware campaign targeting public-facing ESXi servers worldwide. The attackers are likely leveraging a two-year-old heap overflow vulnerability in ESXi's OpenSLP service. Patches for this vulnerability have been available, but the attack has revealed that many servers may still be vulnerable. Users should upgrade to the latest ESXi version and restrict access to the OpenSLP service to trusted IP addresses to mitigate potential threats if patching isnt readily available.</p><p><em>This content was originally published February 8, 2023 and updated February 9, 2023.</em></p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Setting The Scene: Company Core Values, Our Guiding Principles", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Setting The Scene: Company Core Values, Our Guiding Principles"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/company-values-our-guiding-principles"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Company_Core_Values_Main_Feature_5b1e1e961b.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/company-values-our-guiding-principles", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/company-values-our-guiding-principles", "guidislink": false, "published": "Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2023, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 37, 0], "summary": "In this blog, we dive into how our company core values act as guiding principles to help us navigate challenges but also growth.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "In this blog, we dive into how our company core values act as guiding principles to help us navigate challenges but also growth."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<h2 id=\"values-drive-people-people-drive-business-and-business-drives-value\">Values drive people, people drive business, and business drives value</h2><p>Only two years ago, Recorded Future was made up of 570 employees.

For example, a recent vulnerability <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14179\">CVE-2020-14179</a> allowed remote unauthenticated users to view custom fields and custom SLA names by querying the secure /secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa endpoint.</p><p>Similar vulnerabilities have allowed unauthenticated users to enumerate users in a JIRA server (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14181\">CVE-2020-14181</a> / <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36289\">CVE-2020-36289</a>) by accessing the /secure/ViewUserHover.jspa endpoint.</p><p>Other vulnerabilities allowed threat actors to read of certain system-level files, potentially exposing further information about the JIRA configuration (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29453\">CVE-2020-29453</a> / <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26086\">CVE-2021-26086</a>). </p><p>For example, an attacker could make GET requests to the /s/cfx/_/;/.</p><p>Wherein the  could be,</p><ul><li>WEB-INF/web.xml</li><li>WEB-INF/decorators.xml</li><li>WEB-INF/classes/seraph-config.xml</li><li>META-INF/maven/com.atlassian.jira/jira-webapp-dist/pom.properties</li><li>META-INF/maven/com.atlassian.jira/jira-webapp-dist/pom.xml</li><li>META-INF/maven/com.atlassian.jira/atlassian-jira-webapp/pom.xml</li><li>META-INF/maven/com.atlassian.jira/atlassian-jira-webapp/pom.properties</li></ul><p>and JIRA would return the contents of these files, exposing certain configurations and other server information stored within them.</p><p>JIRA has also been a victim of critical vulnerabilities such as complete authentication bypasses by using specially crafted HTTP requests, scoring a 9.8 (Critical) score on the CVE Scale (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0540\">CVE-2022-0540</a>). This vulnerability can be exploited through the use of specific plugins, such as Mobile Plugin for Jira, Insight - Asset Management, allowing attackers to execute certain scripts on the server via the job scheduler configuration at the URL: /secure/WBSGanttManageScheduleJobAction.jspa.</p><p>Looking at another widely used Atlassian tool, Confluence has experienced critical vulnerabilities such as allowing remote attackers to execute code on a Confluence Server (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26084\">CVE-2021-26084</a> / <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26134\">CVE-2022-26134</a>) via injection attacks, while other vulnerabilities allowed attackers to view restricted resources on a Confluence Server (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26085\">CVE-2021-26085</a>), wherein the payload:</p><code style=\"font-family: monospace;\">${(#a=@org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils@toString(@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec(\"id\").getInputStream(),\"utf-8\")).(@com.opensymphony.webwork.ServletActionContext@getResponse().setHeader(\"X-Cmd-Response\",#a))}${(#a=@org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils@toString(@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec(\"id\").getInputStream(),\"utf-8\")).(@com.opensymphony.webwork.ServletActionContext@getResponse().setHeader(\"X-Cmd-Response\",#a))}</code><p><br /><br /></p>was sent as an HTTP response header that executed the command on the server hosting the confluence instance.<p>Beyond these application-level vulnerabilities, popular first-party plugins have also seen critical vulnerabilities. Take, for example <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/atlassian-confluence-vulnerability-remote-access-hard-coded-pass-cve-2022-26138\">CVE-2022-26138</a>, which was caused by a widely used plugin named Questions for Confluence. Developed by Atlassian, the plugin provides a discussion forum-like experience within Confluence by allowing users to ask questions and interact with each other. In short, the plugin created a user within the system named disabledsystemuser, with a hardcoded password, which an unauthenticated attacker with access to these credentials could simply exploit to log in to the Confluence server.</p><p>Looking into vulnerabilities within the software stack itself, <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/atlassian-confluence-remote-code-execution-vulnerability\">CVE-2022-26134</a> is a good example of an Atlassian case in point wherein the vulnerability existed right within the application. Using an Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) injection, an unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server. This vulnerability allowed any code or /command to be executed on a vulnerable server hosting Confluence, allowing the compromised server to be <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/i/atlassian-confluence-vulnerability-cve-2022-26134-abused-for-cryptocurrency-mining-other-malware.html\">used for malware distribution, cryptocurrency mining, and ultimately any other security threat</a>.</p><h2 id=\"identifying-vulnerable-atlassian-based-vulnerabilities-on-your-infrastructure\">Identifying Vulnerable Atlassian-based Vulnerabilities on Your Infrastructure</h2><p>The process of identifying vulnerabilities within an organization's infrastructure is seen as a never-ending, complex task.

Or a coworker texts you, urgently demanding that you send gift cards. Words like fraud and phishing often evoke simple scams that only fool the foolish. In reality, threat actors develop refined tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to target users who believe themselves too clever to be fooled.</p><p>Crypto drainers are malicious scripts that function like e-skimmers and are deployed with phishing techniques to steal victims crypto assets. The phishing pages that are deployed with crypto drainers often imitate popular crypto services and use common third-party applications and extensions (such as MetaMask) that are not unusual for the legitimate services that these phishing pages imitate.</p><p>We discovered a ready-to-go crypto drainer phishing page advertised by a threat actor on a top-tier dark web forum. This phishing page purports to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and uses third-party services that are commonly used in the crypto sphere. After analyzing this crypto drainer, we concluded that it can be effectively used to steal crypto assets from compromised crypto wallets. Once crypto wallets are compromised, no safeguards exist to prevent the theft of crypto assets. Since their first appearance in 2022, crypto drainer phishing pages have surged in popularity, and crypto drainer phishing pages will likely remain relevant, effective, and widely used in 2023.</p><h2 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h2><ul><li>Crypto drainers are used on phishing pages that imitate popular crypto services to steal crypto assets from unsuspecting victims. They exploit legitimate extensions and applications that are frequently used with the crypto services that the phishing pages imitate.</li><li>We analyzed a ready-to-go crypto drainer phishing page advertised by a threat actor on a top-tier dark web forum.

Examples of the crypto services that a crypto drainer phishing page might imitate include cryptocurrency exchanges or non-fungible token (NFT) platforms. Importantly, crypto drainer phishing pages often use third-party services or extensions (such as MetaMask) that are commonly used with the crypto services they imitate. The use of legitimate services on crypto drainer phishing pages may increase the likelihood that the phishing page will pass an otherwise savvy users scam litmus test.</p><p><img alt=\"Crypto-Drainer-Phishing-001.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Crypto_Drainer_Phishing_001_0932f9f2c6.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Recorded Future analyzed a crypto drainer phishing page that entices victims to connect their wallets with the promise of minting NFTs (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Research (Insikt)", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Dark Covenant 2.0: Cybercrime, the Russian State, and the War in Ukraine", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Dark Covenant 2.0: Cybercrime, the Russian State, and the War in Ukraine"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/dark_covenant_2_cybercrime_russian_state_war_ukraine_f6961eaa01.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine", "guidislink": false, "published": "Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2023, 1, 31, 0, 0, 0, 1, 31, 0], "summary": "This report examines the unspoken connections between the Russian Federation, cybercriminals, and self-described hacktivists in Russia and Eastern Europe in the context of the Russian war in Ukraine.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "This report examines the unspoken connections between the Russian Federation, cybercriminals, and self-described hacktivists in Russia and Eastern Europe in the context of the Russian war in Ukraine."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<p><img alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" /></p><p><em>Editors Note: This is an excerpt of a full report.

It is a direct continuation of the findings presented in our 2021 report Dark Covenant: Connections Between the Russian State and Criminal Actors. This report will be of interest to threat researchers, as well as law enforcement, government, and defense organizations.</p><h2 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h2><p>Beginning on February 24, 2022, the Russian cybercriminal threat landscape underwent transformative changes in response to the Russian war in Ukraine. The war brought chaos to the cybercriminal underground, polarizing threat actors in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations. While some cybercriminal groups declared allegiance to the Russian government, others splintered over irreconcilable ideological differences or remained apolitical, opting to capitalize on geopolitical instability for financial gain. Some groups vanished entirely. Likely as indirect consequences of the war, there have been underground market disruptions, shifts in hacktivist and ransomware targeting, and a spike in financial fraud, among other phenomena affecting the Russian cybercriminal ecosystem.</p><p>Throughout these changes, one thing remained largely constant: cybercriminal threat groups continue to occupy important <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-state-connections-criminal-actors\">roles</a>  in direct, indirect, and tacit capacities  with the Russian government. For cybercrime groups who have pledged their allegiance to the Kremlin, the unspoken connections have deepened. Russian cybercriminals and self-described hacktivists are actively involved in operations targeting Ukrainian entities and infrastructure, as well as entities located in states that have declared their support for Ukraine. Recorded Future has observed Russian and Russian-speaking threat actors targeting the United States, United Kingdom, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Japan, and others for financial gain and ego-driven publicity in support of Russia.</p><p><img alt=\"dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine-001.jpg\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/dark_covenant_2_cybercrime_russian_state_war_ukraine_001_6cb4eacdd1.jpg\" /><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Conti Gang statement dated February 25, 2022, in which the group allies itself with the Russian government (Source: Conti.News)</em></p><p>Cybercriminal organizations like Conti have overtly declared allegiance to the Russian government, and commodity malware like DarkCrystal RAT, Colibri Loader, and WarZoneRAT, which are available on top-tier Russian-language forums, are being used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to target entities in Ukraine. We have identified cybercriminal activities preceding the war, and immediately after it started, that we believe are the work of the Russian state. Russian-speaking, self-described hacktivist groups like Killnet and Xaknet are almost certainly actively engaging in information operations (IOs) against organizations and entities in the West, enabled by Russian state-sponsored media with the likely intended goal of stoking fear or decreasing support for Ukraine. We have also identified other phenomena, such as a rise in payment card fraud, database leaks, dark web marketplace closures, and more, that we believe are the consequences of economic, diplomatic, and law enforcement activities aimed at Russian entities due to their support for the war in Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h2><ul><li>It remains highly likely that Russian intelligence, military, and law enforcement services have a longstanding, tacit understanding with cybercriminal threat actors; in some cases, it is almost certain that these agencies maintain an established and systematic relationship with cybercriminal threat actors, either by indirect collaboration or via recruitment. </li><li>Based on our understanding of cybercriminal and hacktivist activities related to the Russian war in Ukraine, it is likely that cybercriminal threat actors are working alongside the Russian state to coordinate or amplify Russian offensive cyber and information operations.</li><li>Russian cybercriminal groups, tools, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) likely serve to provide plausible deniability for state-sponsored threat actors involved in the Russian war in Ukraine. It is likely that financially motivated threat actors who are capitalizing on geopolitical instability are also aiding and abetting the interests of the Russian state, be it coincidentally or intentionally.</li><li>Russian law enforcement seizures of dark web and special-access sources preceding the war appeared to be a show of good faith by the Russian state, signaling its willingness and ability to thwart cybercrime. However, we believe it is likely that these enforcement actions were intended to undermine allegations of cooperation between cybercriminals and the Russian state, providing further plausible deniability.</li><li>Several cybercriminal industries have undergone transformational changes as a result of the Russian war in Ukraine. These include changes to the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) threat landscapes, a rise in Russian payment card fraud, shifts in cybercriminal targeting, changes in infrastructure and hosting, and more.</li></ul><h2 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h2><p>This report synthesizes information derived from open and human sources, including information gathered from monitoring of, and engagement on, dark web, special-access, and social media sources frequented by Russian-speaking cybercriminals. We looked at several English-language forums to cross-reference points of contact and link monikers suspected to be operated by Russian-speaking cybercriminals across the dark web. We also gathered intelligence from open and closed-source messaging platforms, such as Telegram, Tox, and Jabber (XMPP), as well as social media. </p><p>Our collections on ransomware extortion, chat, and payment websites helped us connect various ransomware groups with the Russian state. We used qualitative and quantitative methods to study ransomware victimology before and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, to theorize about motives and ideology. This report relies heavily on the use of the Recorded Future Platform to visualize its findings and draw connections between geopolitical events, cybercriminal threat actors and threat actor groups, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and the Russian state in the context of the Russian war in Ukraine.</p><p>We also rely heavily on other forms of OSINT research, such as academic publications, industry white papers, conference presentations, and more, to fill in gaps in our HUMINT collections process. This report uses previous open-source reporting, as well as the original 2021 <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-state-connections-criminal-actors\">Dark Covenant</a> report, as the background and warrant for its research. This report was researched and written between February 24, 2022 and August 24, 2022.</p><p><img alt=\"dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine-002.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/dark_covenant_2_cybercrime_russian_state_war_ukraine_002_8addf2b8cf.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Timeline of events between the cybercriminal ecosystem, self-described hacktivist entities, and state-sponsored groups during the conflict in Ukraine (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><h3 id=\"dark-covenant\">Dark Covenant</h3><p>In 2021, we <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-state-connections-criminal-actors\">detailed</a> how established, distributed networks of individuals in the Russian cybercriminal world and officials in Russian law enforcement or intelligence services  also known colloquially as siloviki  are connected. The report detailed how the relationships in this ecosystem are often premised on unspoken, yet understood, agreements that consist of malleable associations. This research was based on historical activity, public indictments, and ransomware attacks. Overall, the report broke down the associations between the Russian cybercriminal environment and the siloviki into 3 major categories: direct associations, indirect affiliations, and tacit agreements. </p><ul><li>Direct associations are identified by precise links between state institutions and criminal underground operators; an example of this is Dmitry Dokuchaev, a major in the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) who was recruited after working as a cybercriminal.</li><li>Indirect affiliations occur in cases where a direct link cannot be established but there are clear indications that the Russian government is using resources or personnel for its benefit; an example of this is the Russian governments likely use of the GameOver Zeus botnet for <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Peterson-GameOver-Zeus-Badguys-And-Backends.pdf\">espionage</a> or DDoS attacks by patriotic hackers during military conflicts. </li><li>Tacit agreement is defined as overlaps in cybercriminal activity, including targeting and timing, that benefit Russian state interests or strategic goals; such activity is conducted without direct or indirect links to the state but is allowed by the Kremlin, which looks the other way when such activity is conducted.</li></ul><p>In our 2021 report, we assessed that cybercriminal associations with the siloviki would almost certainly continue for the foreseeable future and these associations and activities would likely adapt to provide greater plausible deniability and fewer overt, direct links between both groups. </p><p>Since our first report, the Russian government has invaded Ukraine, an event that has illuminated our understanding of Russias capabilities and shortcomings as they relate to military strength and cyber capacity. For example, a series of leaks about the cybercriminal groups Conti and Trickbot (Wizard Spider) provided an unprecedented look at the relationship between these groups and the state. The conflict has given rise to self-described hacktivists conducting pro-Russian attacks purportedly motivated by patriotic interest; in some cases, however, it is <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/gru-rise-telegram-minions\">likely</a> that such groups are providing the Russian government with plausible deniability.</p><h3 id=\"the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine\">The Russian Invasion of Ukraine</h3><p>The February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a broader humanitarian crisis in Europe as well as heightened international tensions. A number of pro-Russian threat actor groups, as well as some previously unseen entities from within the cybercriminal ecosystem, have participated in the conflict, which Russia has conducted across the physical, information, and cyber domains. The war has already seen large-scale distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), website defacements, phishing and spam campaigns, malware deployment, and wiper attacks against numerous Ukrainian entities in both the government and private sector. </p><h3 id=\"russian-cybercrime-in-cyber-warfare\">Russian Cybercrime in Cyber Warfare</h3><p>The Russian intelligence services recruitment of highly skilled computer programmers, network specialists, and other technologically savvy personnel dates back to at least the 1990s, according to a <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/12/12/the-fsb-s-personal-hackers\">Meduza</a> report published on December 12, 2019. In this report, an FSB officer is quoted as suggesting that as soon as hackers achieve a certain level of success, they are targeted for recruitment: In [the FSB officers] words, as soon as the first technical college student from a humble background brought a Ferrari out onto the streets of Moscow, FSB agents started recruiting  both getting the cybercrime business under control and making it their own.</p><p>In his 2019 <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/vtorenie-kratkaja-istorija-russkich-chakerov/oclc/1125189608\">book</a> Intrusion: A Brief History of Russian Hackers, Daniil Turovsky quoted an unnamed Russian hacker who provided an account of the associations between the criminal underground and the Russian intelligence services. According to the hacker, the Center for Information Security at the Russian Federal Security Service (CIB FSB) had limited technical staff, so it often brought in outside specialists, reportedly going so far as to hide some hackers in safe houses. </p><p>Andrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist and co-author of The Red Web, a book about the Kremlins online activities, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sheerafrenkel/inside-the-hunt-for-russias-hackers\">said</a> that while the Russian governments tactic of outsourcing cyber operations to various groups helps distance themselves (and ultimately provides deniability), it also left them vulnerable to hackers running amok.</p><h3 id=\"russian-cybercrime-in-foreign-policy\">Russian Cybercrime in Foreign Policy</h3><p>In September 2021, around the time we released our initial Dark Covenant report, we identified a shift in calculus following recent high-profile ransomware attacks and subsequent intergovernmental consultations between the US and Russia. At the time, high-profile ransomware attacks against <a href=\"https://therecord.media/fbi-colonial-pipeline-was-hit-with-darkside-ransomware/\">Colonial Pipeline</a>, <a href=\"https://therecord.media/fbi-jbs-ransomware-attack-was-carried-out-by-revil/\">JBS</a>, and <a href=\"https://therecord.media/revil-ransomware-executes-supply-chain-attack-via-malicious-kaseya-update/\">Kaseya</a> led the US to increase pressure on the Russian government to take action against the cybercriminal groups behind this activity. Around this time, the administrators of 2 major Russian-language forums, Exploit and XSS, quickly banned ransomware topics on their criminal underground platforms, likely as a result of the increased pressure. However, ransomware activities persist in the form of <a href=\"https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/7187714543763-Initial-Access-Brokers-Are-Key-to-Rise-in-Ransomware-Attacks\">initial access</a> and data leak brokerage services.

APT29 and NOBELIUM operations have been <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/\">previously</a> <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/24/new-activity-from-russian-actor-nobelium/\">attributed</a> to Russias Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), an organization responsible for foreign espionage, active measures, and electronic surveillance. In October 2022 we identified BlueBravo staging GraphicalNeutrino malware within a malicious ZIP file. The staging and deployment of this ZIP file overlaps with the previously employed dropper <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0634/\">EnvyScout</a>, the use of which is linked to <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloaked-ursa-online-storage-services-campaigns/\">APT29</a> and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/\">NOBELIUM</a>.</p><p>BlueBravo used a compromised website containing the text &quot;Ambassador`s schedule November 2022&quot; as part of a lure operation. Based on the theme of this lure, we suspect that the targets of this campaign are related to embassy staff or an ambassador. This targeting profile aligns with previous <a href=\"https://inquest.net/blog/2022/04/18/nobelium-israeli-embassy-maldoc\">reporting</a> from InQuest in early 2022 that describes the group, reported as NOBELIUM, employing a lure document titled Ambassador_Absense.docx that displayed content relating to the Embassy of Israel. Following deployment and execution, InQuest reported that the malware, BEATDROP, employed trello[.]com for command-and-control (C2) in an attempt to evade detection and create challenges in attributing the activity.</p><p>Similar to the use of Trello for data exchange by BEATDROP, we have found that GraphicalNeutrino uses the United States (US)-based, business automation service Notion for its C2. The use of the Notion service by BlueBravo is a continuation of their previous tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as they have <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/tracking-apt29-phishing-campaigns\">employed</a> multiple online services such as Trello, Firebase, and Dropbox in an attempt to evade detection. The abuse of legitimate services, such as those employed by BlueBravo, presents a complex issue for network defenders due to the difficulty of defending against malicious access to legitimate services. The use of this technique is becoming more common and will continue to pose a problem for network defenders.</p><p>GraphicalNeutrino acts as a loader with basic C2 functionality and implements numerous anti-analysis techniques including API unhooking, dynamically resolving APIs, string encryption, and sandbox evasion. It leverages Notions API for C2 communications and uses Notions database feature to store victim information and stage payloads for download.</p><p>While we are unable to assess the intended targets of this operation based on the data available, it is likely that ambassadorial or embassy-themed lures are particularly effective during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions, such as is the case with the ongoing war in Ukraine. During such periods, Russian APT groups are highly likely to make extensive use of diplomatically themed lures, as the information potentially gathered from the compromise of entities or individuals receiving such communications is likely to have a direct impact on Russias foreign policy and broader Russian strategic decision-making processes.</p><p>Based on historical APT29 and SVR <a href=\"https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18122307/F-Secure_Dukes_Whitepaper.pdf\">cyber</a> operations and active measures, we assess it is likely that additional countries at the nexus of the conflict are at risk of targeting. This targeting almost certainly represents an ongoing interest from threat actors affiliated with the SVR and aligns with their continued intent to gain access to strategic information from entities and organizations engaged in foreign policy. Any country with a nexus to the Ukraine crisis, particularly those with key geopolitical, economic, or military relationships with Russia or Ukraine, are at increased risk of targeting.</p><h2 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h2><ul><li>We have identified new malware used by BlueBravo, which overlaps with Russian APT activity tracked as APT29 and NOBELIUM, which Western governments and researchers have linked to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).</li><li>Identified staging infrastructure continues the trend of using compromised websites to deliver BlueBravo malware within archive files. The delivery of these files uses the same HTML smuggling technique as EnvyScout.</li><li>The malware also takes advantage of DLL search order hijacking for execution, helping to evade detection on the host.</li><li>A change to Notion as the initial C2 from Trello, Firebase, and Dropbox demonstrates BlueBravos broadening but continued use of legitimate Western services to blend their malware traffic to evade detection.</li><li>Though no second-stage malware, follow-on C2 server, or victims were identified, the initial lure page suggests BlueBravos targeting was related to unknown embassy staff or an ambassador.</li><li>Embassy-related information is likely considered high value intelligence, especially in the midst of the Russian war in Ukraine.</li></ul><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><p>BlueBravos targeting, its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and its targeting interests and operations overlap with Russian advanced persistent threat activity publicly reported as APT29 and NOBELIUM, which has been <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/\">previously</a> <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/24/new-activity-from-russian-actor-nobelium/\">attributed</a> to Russias Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).

ChatGPT <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\">launched</a> on November 30, 2022, and has been subject to widespread attention. Among the potential advantages of ChatGPT, we have also identified several potential use cases ripe for abuse. While ChatGPT has the potential to be abused by nation-state actors to enable cyberespionage, information operations (IOs), and disruptive cyberattacks (cyberwarfare), we believe these use cases are not as immediate threats as those posed by cybercriminals. Short term, we believe that non-state actors with limited technical knowledge and resources pose a more serious threat via the malicious use of ChatGPT. </p><p>The types of threat actors that we believe currently pose the most threat can be classified as script kiddies, hacktivists, scammers and spammers, payment card fraudsters, and threat actors engaging in other lowly and disreputable forms of cybercrime. Within days of the ChatGPT launch, we identified many threat actors on dark web and special-access forums sharing buggy but functional malware, social engineering tutorials, money-making schemes, and more  all enabled by the use of ChatGPT. While none of these activities have risen to the seriousness of ransomware, data extortion, denial of service, cyberterrorism, and so on, these attack vectors remain possibilities.</p><p>This report uses ChatGPT itself, sometimes in its own words, to demonstrate its functionality, rationalize its use and abuse, and replicate threats that currently exist in the cybercriminal underground.</p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>ChatGPT lowers the barrier to entry for threat actors with limited programming abilities or technical skills. It can produce effective results with just an elementary level of understanding in the fundamentals of cybersecurity and computer science.</li><li>We identified threat actors on dark web and special-access sources sharing proof-of-concept ChatGPT conversations that enable malware development, social engineering, disinformation, phishing, malvertising, and money-making schemes.</li><li>We believe that non-state threat actors pose the most immediate threat to individuals, organizations, and governments via the malicious use of ChatGPT.</li><li>With limited time and experience on the ChatGPT platform, we were able to replicate malicious code identified on dark web and special-access forums.</li></ul><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><p><strong>(The following description was written by ChatGPT and transcribed verbatim in response to the prompt to provide a detailed response addressing its history and functionality.)</strong></p><p><em>ChatGPT, or the Generative Pre-training Transformer, is a powerful conversational language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the GPT architecture and was first released in 2019. Since then, it has undergone several updates, including the release of version 3 in 2020.</em></p><p><em>The model was trained on a large corpus of text data and is capable of understanding and responding to a wide range of topics and prompts. This makes it highly versatile and well-suited for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including question answering, language translation, text summarization, and even creative writing. One of the key strengths of ChatGPT is its ability to generate highly coherent and contextually appropriate text, which is why it is often used in applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated writing.</em></p><p><em>The model's large capacity allows it to perform well on NLP tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This makes it an attractive option for developers and researchers looking to build custom NLP models without the need for extensive training data. However, it's important to note that ChatGPT is a unidirectional model, meaning it can only generate text based on the input it has been given. This means that it is not able to answer questions that rely on understanding the context of the conversation or the world.</em></p><p><em>One of the most common use cases for ChatGPT is in chatbot development. The model's ability to generate human-like text makes it well-suited for creating chatbot conversations that are natural and engaging for users. This can be especially useful for customer service chatbots, which can handle a wide range of customer queries and complaints without the need for human intervention.</em></p><p><em>Another popular use case for ChatGPT is in automated writing. The model can be fine-tuned to generate articles, stories, and other forms of written content with a high degree of coherence and fluency. This can be useful for content generation in a variety of industries, including journalism, marketing, and publishing.</em></p><p><em>Additionally, ChatGPT can be used for language translation, which can be highly beneficial for companies and organizations that operate in multiple languages. The model can be fine-tuned to translate text from one language to another with a high degree of accuracy, which can save companies significant time and resources.</em></p><p><em>In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful conversational language model that can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks. Its ability to generate highly coherent and contextually appropriate text makes it well-suited for applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated writing. Additionally, its large capacity allows it to perform well on NLP tasks with minimal fine-tuning, making it an attractive option for developers and researchers looking to build custom NLP models.</em></p><p>ChatGPT was launched publicly by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. In the following weeks, it garnered widespread media attention for its functionality and its seemingly boundless potential for future use. Researchers, academics, and journalists speculated on use cases. Among the proposed benefits of ChatGPT include the <a href=\"https://devops.com/will-chatgpt-replace-developers/\">automation of engineering tasks</a>, applications for <a href=\"https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/mastering-chatgpt-in-python-a53814e834b0?gi=8325a6c93293\">data science</a> and analytics, software development, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html\">educational technology</a> (edtech), and much more.</p><p><img alt=\"Chatbot-001.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_001_9e6b3aa192.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> References to ChatGPT on dark web and special-access forums (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Amid the excitement, optimism, and <a href=\"https://mindmatters.ai/2022/12/yes-chatgpt-is-sentient-because-its-really-humans-in-the-loop/\">transhumanist thought-experimenting</a>, some cynicism has been expressed about the use of ChatGPT for deceptive, unethical, or malicious purposes. Some have argued that ChatGPT should be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/01/05/nyc-schools-ban-chatgpt/\">banned in schools</a> due to its potential for enabling <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/01/13/chatgpt-schools-teachers-ai-debate\">plagiarism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e97b7ce-8223-431e-a61d-1e462b6893c3\">systemic cheating</a> on homework, writing assignments, and take-home exams. Others believe that its open registration policy makes it easily accessible for threat actors <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/01/10/hackers-chatgpt-malware-cybercrime-ai\">interested in developing malware</a>, gaining unauthorized access to networks, or <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3685368/study-shows-attackers-can-use-chatgpt-to-significantly-enhance-phishing-and-bec-scams.html\">coordinating convincing phishing campaigns</a>. These debates raise questions about the authenticity and accuracy of ChatGPT (which is expected to improve over time) and its effects on the job market, remote work and education, freelancing, and more. </p><p>Will ChatGPT cause a widespread market disruption and displace individuals in affected roles? As an experiment, we examined some of the top-rated listings from the most active content creators on freelancing platforms such as Fiverr. We used ChatGPT to replicate these tasks, generating 500 to 1,000-word research papers in seconds, as well as miscellaneous technical tasks.</p><p><img alt=\"Chatbot-002.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_002_861f9f62fd.png\" /><img alt=\"Chatbot-003.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_003_0ca2dea600.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> ChatGPT performing Writing &amp; Translation tasks commonly advertised on the Fiverr freelancing platform.

Threat actors also claim to have written e-books with ChatGPT, which they have allegedly listed for sale under false pen names on popular marketplaces. In some cases, these same threat actors have publicly claimed to make upwards of $4,000 per day abusing ChatGPT to deceive clients and customers. We believe that these earnings claims are possible, but likely an exaggeration intended to direct traffic to the authors profile.</p><p>Cybercriminals have also used ChatGPT to write scripts that automate commands such as dice rolling and strategic betting for online casinos and sports betting platforms, cheat on online videogames, create fraudulent affiliate marketing redirects to earn passive income, and more. Many of these tutorials are openly accessible on forums, messaging platforms, and social media frequented by cybercriminals and require no prior registration to view. </p><p>Below is a sample of such advertisements from the low-tier, English-language Cracked Forum, between December 16, 2022, and January 2, 2023:</p><p><img alt=\"Chatbot-006.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_006_7e3d3f9c89.png\" /><img alt=\"Chatbot-007.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_007_ef8257084f.png\" /><img alt=\"Chatbot-008.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_008_56dd27f671.png\" /><img alt=\"Chatbot-009.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_009_7404148115.png\" /><img alt=\"Chatbot-010.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_010_37e82a7291.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Cybercriminal advertisements and tutorials on the low-tier Cracked Forum for money-making schemes using ChatGPT.

(Source: Cracked Forum)</em></p><p>With the rise of ChatGPT in popularity on dark web and special-access forums also comes an influx of threat actors asking to register untraceable, unattributable, or fraudulent accounts with OpenAI that violate the ChatGPT community standards. In some cases, especially for threat actors physically located in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), tutorials for registering accounts with temporary (burner) Russian phone numbers have also appeared.</p><p><img alt=\"Chatbot-011.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_011_f662fd69cd.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> MrK inquires about registering an account without a phone number (Source: Recorded Future, BreachForums)</em></p><p><img alt=\"Chatbot-012.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_012_6858b4e379.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Lorensaire, a member of the top-tier Russian-language cybercriminal forum XSS, inquires about acquiring an OpenAI application programming interface (API) key without the use of a verified phone number.

These articles, while showing the potential threat of ChatGPT abuse, have also brought attention to the threat actors that are engaging in such activities  to an extent, possibly legitimizing them and solidifying their reputation. While many threat actors are opportunistic and financially motivated, some are ego-driven and inspired by media attention.</p><p><img alt=\"Chatbot-013.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Chatbot_013_cf621255f8.png\" /><em><strong>Figure 7:</strong> The threat actor 0x27 acknowledges reporting on the malicious use of ChatGPT, which includes references to previous threads authored by 0x27 and USDoD on BreachForums.

To enable this reliance, financial services organizations have long harvested the benefits of technology and spurred a wave of advancements capitalizing on new opportunities, from improved speed and convenience to an enhanced customer experience. </p><p>But while tremendous innovations in internet banking, mobile apps, and instant payments have made these benefits possible, they have also opened new attack vectors and potential exposures in the IT infrastructure of financial service providers and challenged their core: customer trust. </p><p>Financial services organizations across the globe must, at all times, secure customer data and maintain their confidence. Such a challenge is compounded by the stringent regulations that surround the handling of consumer data. And with the threat of massive financial, regulatory and reputational consequences hanging in the balance, fortified cybersecurity is not only a commodity; its a necessity.</p><h3 id=\"importance-of-cybersecurity-for-financial-services-organizations\">Importance of Cybersecurity for Financial Services Organizations</h3><p>It has been five years since the massive <a href=\"https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/\">Equifax breach</a>, which involved the loss of 148 million personal records and led to a $700 million court settlement. The Equifax breach had a wide-reaching blast radius, impacting and challenging attitudes toward cybersecurity across the global financial sector and the public. Unfortunately, the most significant lessons learned from this breach havent seemed to take. </p><p>In 2020, Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank and former head of the International Monetary Fund, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/02/08/645-billion-cyber-risk-could-trigger-liquidity-crisis-ecbs-lagarde-warns/?sh=527a75457ca8\">warned</a> that a severe cyberattack could trigger a financial crisis. While most financial institutions plan to or are already investing heavily in cybersecurity, financial data breaches accounted for 153.3 million leaked records from January 2018 to June 2022, according to <a href=\"https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/financial-data-breaches/\">research by Comparitech</a>. </p><p>What trends are exacerbating the current cyber risk faced by financial services providers? </p><p>The financial sectors ongoing digital transformation and the post-pandemic increase in cloud reliance have caused the sectors attack surface to grow exponentially, exposing organizations to increased cyber threats. The current economic turmoil has also led to a rise in malicious actors looking to steal sensitive information and sell it on the dark market, or to commit fraud and gain access to an accounts funds. And because financial services organizations work with large amounts of information about clients, partners and employees, such sensitive data makes them ideal targets for cybercriminals. </p><h3 id=\"top-cyber-threats-to-financial-services-in-2023\">Top Cyber Threats to Financial Services in 2023</h3><p>To better understand how modern financial institutions can boost their cyber resilience and keep their infrastructure and data secure, lets examine the current state of financial service providers' most perilous cyber threats across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.</p><h3 id=\"phishing\">Phishing</h3><p>Phishing attacks often involve emails designed to appear legitimateto trick the user into opening a malicious link that installs malware on the recipient's computer or visiting a website domain designed to look convincing enough for the visitor to log in and divulge their credentials. This can cause severe financial and reputational damage to financial organizations. </p><p>Phishing attacks are common in financial services organizations. Recently, <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/dangeroussavanna-two-year-long-campaign-targets-financial-institutions-in-french-speaking-africa/\">news broke out</a> that a persistent campaign has been targeting major financial institutions in French-speaking African countries for over the last two years. The campaign was discovered by Check Point Research and dubbed 'DangerousSavanna.' It relied on spear phishing to infect the computers of major financial corporations employees and successfully affected at least three organizations. </p><h3 id=\"ransomware\">Ransomware</h3><p>Ransomware is one of the biggest cyber threats organizations face in the global financial industry. A <a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/08/10/the-state-of-ransomware-in-financial-services-2022/\">report by Sophos</a> shows that ransomware attacks on financial services have increased, with 55% of organizations impacted during 2021.</p><p>Ransomware is a type of malware that targets individual users or systems, encrypting a specific number of files on disk only to deny access to the owner at a later time. Access to those files can be restored after a ransom is paid. One of the oldest tricks in the book, ransomware attacks introduce large costs of remediation: financial services organizations have reported that the average remediation cost for ransomware attacks is $1.59 million. </p><h3 id=\"ddos-attacks\">DDoS Attacks</h3><p>While other cyber threats commonly aim to steal sensitive data, cyber criminals use distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks to flood a website with traffic from various compromised devices and IPs, causing it to crash. DDoS attacks can interrupt and fully stop business operations, leading to significant financial losses. They are especially common and dangerous for financial services organizations.</p><p>In 2021, a German organization operating technology for the countrys cooperative banks, Fiducia &amp; GAD IT, suffered a DDoS attack that impacted over 800 financial institutions. And financial services organizations across the entire EMEA region and North America are at risk of ransomware attacks as well. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.radware.com/pleaseregister.aspx/?returnurl=18bf850e-6320-44a7-85e3-65f9ef072dc8\">report by Radware</a> shows that in 2021, 25% of all DDoS attacks affected the financial industry, making it the most targeted sector. This is due to DDoS attacks often being used as part of a more complex attack chain, where taking down a website is merely a distraction from an even more serious action, such as an entire account takeover or money laundering. </p><h3 id=\"exploitation-of-vulnerabilities-and-misconfigurations\">Exploitation of Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations</h3><p>Exploiting known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations is one of the most common attack vectors malicious actors use for initial access, allowing them to target several organizations at once. By scanning for assets containing vulnerabilities during the first stages of an attack, attackers can target many organizations. </p><p>Meanwhile, exploitation of security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations has been testing financial cyber defense strategies globally. For example, who can forget the <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/apache-log4j-vulnerability\">Log4J vulnerability</a> that impacted critical infrastructure, including financial services? </p><p>As mentioned, financial services organizations have taken advantage of cloud technology and achieved many digital transformation successes. This includes new digital services, the use of third-party software, platform modernization, and the deployment of new technologies. In turn, all this growth largely extends attack surfaces across financial services organizations. Such a complex environment can make it challenging for organizations to identify, monitor, and protect each digital asset, while even a single misconfiguration can provide attackers with the initial entry point they need. </p><h3 id=\"supply-chain-attacks\">Supply Chain Attacks</h3><p>Supply chain attacks are becoming more widespread and more sophisticated. The <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know\">SolarWinds attack</a> showed how a cyberattack on a single vendor could have a blast radius impacting governments and organizations worldwide. </p><p>As financial organizations increasingly use third-party vendors to host, connect, and protect a large part of their IT infrastructures, managing cyber risks in supply chains is one of the biggest security challenges for organizations everywhere. <a href=\"https://www.marsh.com/zm/services/cyber-risk/insights/mea-business-leaders-woefully-unprepared-for-cyber-attack.html\">Reports</a> show that the vast majority of Middle East and African business leaders across large organizations, including financial, struggle to understand the risks their digital supply chains pose. With governments imposing strict regulations on financial services, visibility and management of their third-party infrastructure are crucial to avoid damaging cyberattacks. </p><h3 id=\"how-to-reduce-attack-surface-exposure-and-mitigate-security-risks-to-financial-services\">How to Reduce Attack Surface Exposure and Mitigate Security Risks to Financial Services</h3><p>Through digital transformation, financial services organizations are more dependent on the internet than ever. Its many advancements have resulted in the proliferation of countless digital assets across financial institutions. With so many cyber threats increasingly targeting financial services and their ever-growing IT infrastructures, the ability to have a real-time, full understanding and overview of all internet-connected assets becomes a key role in fortifying their security posture. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/attack-surface-intelligence\">Recorded Futures Attack Surface Intelligence</a> is a platform that allows organizations to achieve proactive attack surface monitoring and uncover any blind spots, empowering security teams to prioritize and mitigate risk across their evolving IT infrastructure. </p><h4 id=\"asset-discovery\">Asset Discovery</h4><p>Without a complete overview of an organizations internet-facing assets, its easy to overlook a vulnerability. For instance, when a certain CVE is observed in the wild, it can be hard to discover and mitigate if you dont know what assets need scanning. Furthermore, if a cyberattack occurs, lacking a complete inventory of all your assets can make the threat identification process much longer, leading to a more disruptive incident.</p><p>Keeping an accurate, up-to-date asset inventory is essential for any financial services organization that utilizes internet-connected resources. With 10+ years of historical data and deep context on hostnames, domains, IPs, SSL certificates, and more, Attack Surface Intelligence provides financial organizations with a straightforward way to manage their attack surface as it grows, allowing them to spot any inconsistencies that can signal risk, such as phishing domains. </p><p><img alt=\"attack-surface-threats-to-financial-services-2023-fig-1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/attack_surface_threats_to_financial_services_2023_fig_1_f0b654c4ae.png\" /></p><h4 id=\"infrastructure-monitoring\">Infrastructure Monitoring</h4><p>Because it's imperative to fully know and understand your entire IT infrastructure, Attack Surface Intelligences continuous monitoring provides real-time visibility into all digital assets and their changes. As one's attack surface is constantly evolving, having this continuous visibility into its state, location, and overall security rate is critical in understanding your digital footprint and the risks that could lead to a cyberattack. With continuous infrastructure monitoring, security teams can be aware of the risk as soon as it appears on an asset, providing a timely chance to accelerate remediation. </p><p><img alt=\"attack-surface-threats-to-financial-services-2023-fig-2.jpeg\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/attack_surface_threats_to_financial_services_2023_fig_2_a6475ab7e8.jpeg\" /></p><h4 id=\"exposure-detection\">Exposure Detection</h4><p>With third-party risk and supply chain attacks posing a significant threat to financial service organizations, its crucial to monitor and maintain an inventory of all these resources and to be able to find any exposures. </p><p>Thats why Attack Surface Intelligences Inventory Tab has a handy feature: Admin Panels. </p><p>Admin Panels locates administrator panels from popular technologies and software in mere seconds. This allows security teams to find exposed control panels that may be out of compliance with policies, adding unnecessary risk to your organization.</p><p>Among its many highlights, the Admin Panel detects all affected IP addresses and hostnames. </p><p><img alt=\"attack-surface-threats-to-financial-services-2023-fig-3.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/attack_surface_threats_to_financial_services_2023_fig_3_aa77620dac.png\" /></p><h4 id=\"risk-mitigation\">Risk Mitigation</h4><p>While discovering assets containing risks and vulnerabilities, Attack Surface Intelligence provides contextual information to improve risk mitigation. Risk Rules uncovers the most significant weaknesses within the attack surface, making identifying and prioritizing risks easy.</p><p>Listing the key risks of digital assets and classifying them based on severity allows security teams to prioritize remediation. To mitigate common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, Risk Rules includes deep insight into risk severity, affected hostnames, technical references found on the internet, and project metadata such as ID, title, and snapshot creation date of a CVE. </p><p><img alt=\"attack-surface-threats-to-financial-services-2023-fig-4.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/attack_surface_threats_to_financial_services_2023_fig_4_cecf216709.png\" /></p><p>Financial services organizations need a modern, robust security solution to manage and protect their growing IT infrastructures in the wake of increased cyber threats, regulations, and consumer demand. </p><p>Learn how world-class financial organizations use Attack Surface Intelligence to monitor, manage and control their critical data. <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/attack-surface-intelligence-demo-request?utm_campaign=SecurityTrails%202022&amp;utm_source=securitytrails&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_term=dedicated&amp;utm_content=20220713\">Book your Demo Today</a>.</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Annual Payment Fraud Intelligence Report: 2022", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Annual Payment Fraud Intelligence Report: 2022"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/annual-payment-fraud-intelligence-report-2022"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/annual_payment_fraud_intelligence_report_2022_c59a144484.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/annual-payment-fraud-intelligence-report-2022", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/annual-payment-fraud-intelligence-report-2022", "guidislink": false, "published": "Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2023, 1, 17, 0, 0, 0, 1, 17, 0], "summary": "Recorded Future's Insikt Group details the top trends and metrics of the payment card fraud landscape in 2022 and provides insights into what to expect in 2023.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Recorded Future's Insikt Group details the top trends and metrics of the payment card fraud landscape in 2022 and provides insights into what to expect in 2023."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<p><img alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" /></p><p><em>Editors Note: This is an excerpt of a full report.

The target audience of this report is fraud and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) teams at financial institutions and merchant services companies.</em></p><h3 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h3><p>2022 was a year of system shocks, and the payment card fraud market did not survive unscathed. Russias cybercrime crackdown  followed promptly by its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  spawned lower carding volumes for the remainder of the year. In total, 2022 saw 45.6 million card-not-present (CNP) and 13.8 million card-present (CP) payment card records posted for sale to carding shops on the dark web. These figures were considerably lower than the 60 million CNP and 36 million CP records posted for sale in 2021. Taken together, this decreased supply, demand, and turnover defined the payment card fraud market and threat landscape throughout 2022.</p><p>In spite of this, the card fraud market and the threat actors who populate it demonstrated remarkable resilience. Magecart actors launched campaigns that employed fake payment card forms, exploited legitimate merchant web infrastructure to deploy e-skimmers, and used HTTP referer headers to impede remediation by security analysts. One of these campaigns led to the compromise of 2 online ordering platforms, a trending tactic that exposes merchants who use the platforms to the risk of being compromised. Meanwhile, high-profile merchants were increasingly exploited by individual threat actors and checker services on the dark web in order to verify the validity of stolen cards. And finally, as war in Ukraine hampered cybercriminals ability to engage in card fraud, one top-tier carding shop exploited the lull in supply by flooding the market with recycled payment card records. Although frustrated by these records low quality, resourceful threat actors may nevertheless use them as cheap sources of personally identifiable information (PII) that they can weaponize to carry out targeted account takeover (ATO) attacks against their victims.</p><p>By employing proactive anti-fraud strategies that integrate intelligence from throughout the payment fraud life cycle, financial institutions and card issuers can reduce card fraud losses in 2023. The overall level of card fraud activity in 2023 will be highly dependent on whether or not Russias war in Ukraine continues; if it does, threat actors ability to engage in card fraud will likely remain degraded. But should the war end, a renewal or increase in payment card fraud may follow.</p><h3 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h3><ul><li>45.6 million CNP payment card records were posted across dark web carding shops in 2022, down 24% from 2021. It is highly likely that this years relatively low CNP volumes are the result of Russias early-2022 cybercrime crackdown and its subsequent full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In 2022, the highest-impact CNP breaches affected online ordering platforms.</li><li>13.8 million CP payment card records were posted across dark web carding shops in 2022, down 62% from 2021. While it is possible the years events contributed to this drop-off, year-by-year CP volumes have also steadily declined due to the rising global adoption of more secure in-person payment methods. In 2022, CP breaches overwhelmingly affected small restaurants and bars.</li><li>The Recorded Future Magecart Overwatch program discovered 1,520 unique malicious domains involved in the infections of 9,290 unique e-commerce domains at any point in 2022. </li><li>Full primary account numbers (PANs) for at least 20.5 million compromised payment cards were posted as plaintext or images to various resources including dark web forums, pastebins, and social media.</li><li>21 card checker services monitored by Recorded Future abused 2,953 unique merchants associated with 660 unique merchant identification numbers (MIDs) for illicit card checks.</li><li>Threat actors focused on avoiding or bypassing protections offered by the 3-D Secure (3DS) protocol and increasingly discussed the abuse of customer service call centers as a means of facilitating their attacks. Furthermore, a surge in cheap, reposted payment card records posted throughout 2022 increased the attack surface for ATO attacks.</li><li>The payment fraud life cycle closely resembles a real-world market underpinned by supply chains, coordinated exchange between buyers and sellers, and the provision of services such as checkers. Although this high degree of organization increases the opportunities and impact of card fraud, it also produces a data-rich environment. Therefore, card issuers, acquirers, and merchant service providers should incorporate and integrate intelligence from across the payment fraud life cycle to proactively combat fraud.</li></ul><h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3><p>Payment card fraud exists as part of a sophisticated underground economy. Production networks, supply chains, and dark web carding shops provide threat actors with the means to market criminal services and wares to their peers or to purvey stolen data to end users who engage in card fraud. Within this shadow economy, payment card fraud conforms to a certain life cycle, as seen in Figure 1 below.</p><p><img alt=\"annual-payment-fraud-intelligence-report-2022-fig1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/annual_payment_fraud_intelligence_report_2022_fig1_aa0df5f3f0.png\" /><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Payment card fraud conforms to a general life cycle (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>At the beginning of the life cycle, physical compromises facilitate the theft of payment card data from merchants card-present (CP) transactions. Meanwhile, cybercriminals enact digital compromises  often with Magecart e-skimmer infections  to steal card data from online card-not-present (CNP) transactions. These stolen card records are posted for sale to the dark web, where partial payment card data is put on display so criminal buyers can go window shopping. Occasionally, carding shops release full stolen payment card data for promotional purposes, which provides one of the many opportunities for criminals to snatch up full primary account numbers (PANs). Before making a sale, carding shops use aptly named checkers to appraise stolen card sets; individual criminals use the same checkers to verify their records validity before or after purchase. Once end user fraudulent actors acquire their desired payment card data, they monetize it, usually through fraudulent transactions. If actors can acquire enough of a victims personally identifiable information (PII), they can even attempt account takeover (ATO) attacks to cash out their victims bank account.</p><p>Throughout 2022, Recorded Future monitored this shadow economy to empower clients to disrupt fraud at every stage of the payment card fraud life cycle. In the course of our monitoring, we observed both continuing trends from 2021 and novel trends that grew organically from the events of 2022.</p><p><em>Editors Note: This is an excerpt of a full report.

Apart from the exigencies placed by first-to-market conditions and similar drivers, aspiring leaders in this arena must contend with a hodgepodge of disparate technologies just to keep pace with the growing demands. In doing so, however, entities are often saddled with a host of asset discovery and management woes that threaten the very fabric of any modern cyber defense program, and legacy implementations and systems are particularly susceptible to this reality.</p><p>But even if competitive advantage isnt one of the desired outcomesas in the case of industry verticals supported by Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control System (ICS in its plural form) collectivesasset reconciliation in these fixed-inventory ecosystems is still considered a top priority. This rationale takes an even deeper meaning if we also examine the buoying IT-OT convergence: A phenomenon marked by a shift from a motley of monitoring and control mechanisms to a cohesive IoT (Internet of Things)-based model signaling improved networking, storage, and instrumentation capabilities. Further complicating this picture is an ever-present menagerie of specialized communication protocols, with identification challenges arising partly from a small subset of these outside the aegis of the TCP/IP stack.</p><p>Owing to ICS dominant role in the operation and security of critical infrastructure, we premise this post on the idea that obtaining an accurate asset inventory within such environments is riddled with inherent technical and safety hurdles. Under the guidance of NISTs Special Publication 800-82, well attempt to provide a decent margin for understanding such historical constraints and some awareness of the road ahead.</p><h2 id=\"framing-the-challenges-a-primer-of-ics-terminology-and-protocols\">Framing the challenges: A primer of ICS terminology and protocols</h2><p>ICS are the digital and physical control lifeblood of the modern industrial complex. From oil and natural gas operations to food and beverage business conglomerates, ICS are vital to the proper functioning of highly-sensitive components. Hitherto, theyve acquired a high degree of autonomy and isolation from traditional IT networks, and for good measure: an overriding human safety factor precedes any other underlying implication. For instance, a recent path traversal <a href=\"https://therecord.media/high-severity-vulnerability-found-in-computers-used-by-large-oil-and-gas-utilities/\">vulnerability</a> discovered in flow computersa special-purpose digital device accounting for the fiscal transfer of hydrocarbonsis believed to pose the same risks as those which led to the now-infamous <a href=\"https://therecord.media/tag/colonial-pipeline/\">Colonial Pipeline incident</a>.</p><p>So, if restricting physical and logical access to these environments is critical to prevent disruptions, it is relatively common to find ICS employing some form of air gap scenariowhen properly implemented and supervised, this kind of segmentation between the more prominent IT and ICS/OT topologies can provide reasonable assurance. Embedded in the latter is where wed find the likes of <em>programmable logic controllers</em> (PLCs) or <em>remote terminal units</em> (RTUs); these represent low-level control systems with the ability to send equipment telemetry and data from field instruments either wirelessly or via standard communication cables.</p><p>Predictably, all these data retrieval and update functions call for centralized administration, and thats where Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems come in; in turn, SCADA implementations are capable of handling a multitude of geographically dispersed assets in near real-time, automating any resulting tasks under a single visualization dashboard known as a Human-Machine Interface, or HMI.</p><p>Setting ICS/OT and IT even further apart is an entire proprietary and legacy array of dedicated protocolsthese include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>DNP3:</strong> An early fixture of the utility sector, this TCP/IP-based protocol provides the messaging scaffold and rules used in substation local area networks (LANs) linking remote equipment with their corresponding control centers. Originally designed with interoperability and optimization in mind, the DNP3 international standard is still widely popular, with electrical and water industries leading the way in its implementation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modbus:</strong> Introduced in 1979, Modbus also encapsulates and sends commands and data over TCP/IP. Born a serial, point-to-point, and response-request protocol, Modbus quickly outgrew any proprietary messaging structures in favor of an Ethernet-based variant to accommodate the growing demand for concurrent, long-lived connections.</p></li><li><p><strong>ICCP:</strong> ICCP, or the TASE.2 protocol, is the de facto standard that transmits process control data between utility control centers and similar energy-accounting infrastructure. This real-time data exchange takes place in client-server fashion, with secure extensions relying on transport layer security mechanisms for encryption and authentication purposes. Unlike Modbus, ICCP consists of a multi-layered stack of protocols specifically designed to work over LANs, although its ability to cross organizational boundaries is well established.</p></li><li><p><strong>RS-232 and RS-485:</strong> Despite early distance limitations and similar drawbacks, these serial (or parallel) communication interfaces are still commonplace due to their reliability and simplicity. Introduced in the late 1990sapropos of the evolving computer peripheral industrythe RS-485 standard embodies the latest in rugged physical design destined for harsh industrial environments where large amounts of electrical noise immunity and other special safety features are typically required.</p></li></ul><p>Of course, the list above is by no means exhaustive. There are additional protocols like BACnet or Profibus, whose open-standard nature has ensured continuous growth in the automation sector, specifically in the centralized management of measuring equipment and RTUs.</p><h2 id=\"securing-ics-asset-management-challenges-and-beyond\">Securing ICS: Asset management challenges and beyond</h2><p>As it stands, the siloed ecosystem that was once ICS/OT has seen a steady increase in the adoption of corporate-like IT solutions and technologies ranging from low-cost physical layer devices and transmission media to operating system considerations that resemble mainstream client-server solutions.

We found that Turkish patriotic hacking collectives are continuing their defacement operations and at least 1 threat group is working to engage in more sophisticated hacking activities. Turkish-language cybercriminals are active on English- and Russian-language forums where they share and sell compromised data from Turkish entities. In our research, we identified at least 3 Turkish-language ransomware groups and we developed a YARA rule to detect TurkStatik Ransomware. </p><p>With the prevalence of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) models and the resulting decrease in barriers for entry to the ransomware space, we expect an increase in the number of Turkish-language ransomware groups. As a cornerstone of the Turkish underground community, we expect patriotic hacking collectives to continue their operations. </p><h2 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h2><ul><li>Turkish patriotic hackers continue their defacement operations targeting countries they perceive to be enemies of Turkey, and in some cases aim to ramp up the sophistication of their activities including leaking confidential data and building a hacktivist botnet.</li><li>Turkish-language, financially motivated threat actors advertise their services, methods, and stolen data on popular global forums to avoid Turkish law enforcement attention and appeal to a larger audience. We identified at least 3 Turkish-language ransomware variants being used by threat groups including TurkStatik, SifreCikis, and DeadLocker. At the time of this report, we do not know the number of victims in Turkey affected by these ransomware variants as the operators of said ransomware do not operate extortion websites.</li></ul><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><p>As outlined in our previous reporting, Turkish-speaking dark web communities primarily focus on 2 functional areas: patriotic hacking (hacktivism) and financially motivated cybercrime. Patriotic hacking communities frequently respond to geopolitical events around the world, especially those relating to Turkey, and show support for the government agenda by targeting countries perceived to be enemies of Turkey. Financially motivated communities focus on a variety of fraud-related activities such as payment card fraud, data breaches, and social engineering. Due to pressure from law enforcement, Turkish-language forums do not host content, data, or methods targeting Turkish organizations. A majority of the compromised data and attack methods targeting Turkish organizations are found on English- or Russian-language forums like BreachForums, XSS, and Exploit. </p><p>Increased political and financial instability in Turkey are likely contributing factors to the popularity of dark web forums and financially motivated cybercrime. Researchers have <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334641577_Unemployment_Migration_and_Cyber_Criminality_in_Nigeria\">argued</a> for a correlation between financial instability (particularly youth unemployment) and cybercrime rates, using the <a href=\"https://www.nairaland.com/4057843/tackling-unemployment-youth-involvement-cybercrime\">case study</a> of Nigeria as an example. On October 3, 2022, data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-inflation-hits-fresh-24-year-high-83-after-rate-cuts-2022-10-03/\">showed</a> that inflation levels hit a 24-year high with 83.45% inflation, while independent experts at the Inflation Research Group (a private research group in Turkey) <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63120478\">estimate</a> the annual rate to be much higher at approximately 186.27%. Despite high inflation rates, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has been pursuing an unorthodox easing cycle approach by lowering interest rates. As a result, the Turkish lira lost 44% of its value against the dollar in 2021, and the lira hit an all-time low in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-cenbank-shocks-again-with-100-point-rate-cut-2022-09-22/\">September 2022</a> with a further 100-point reduction in interest rates.

Youll see the difference that intelligence makes in hunting for threats in each of the main areas of security: Monitoring, Integrating, and Analyzing.</p><h3 id=\"monitoring-detecting-relevant-threats-to-your-organization\">Monitoring: Detecting relevant threats to your organization</h3><p>Of the numerous kinds of <em>possible</em> attacks, which ones are <em>relevant</em>, given your business and environment? Since you cant send your security teams down every rabbit hole, monitoring is the process of collecting observations and checking them for the specific threat indicators that are relevant to you.In checking these observations, this workflow uses Technical Links, which are high-confidence, evidence-based threats linked in a meaningful way. Recorded Future summarizes Technical Links from sources of fine-grained technical intelligence, as shown below. </p><p><img alt=\"Anatomy of a Threat Hunt 001.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Anatomy_of_a_Threat_Hunt_001_fc2f8232a8.png\" /></p><p>Recorded Future validates Technical Links by analyzing multiple categories of threat intelligence findings, including the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Network Traffic</strong>  Based on midpoint traffic data on the internet among threat actors, malicious infrastructure, and victims. </li><li><strong>Malware</strong>  Based on file samples, including executable files and documents. Most input samples are sourced from automated data collection and partner data collection. Some samples are uploaded by analysts using Recorded Futures community-only sandbox. Analysis methods include static file analysis, sandbox execution, and detailed research analysis of code, memory, and sample behavior.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure Analysis</strong>  Based on specific internet infrastructures, such as IP addresses, domains, and URLs. Data collection methods include broad and targeted scanning, and receiving inbound traffic (honeypots, etc.). Analysis methods include pattern-based detections.Recorded Future Intelligence Cards consolidate these findings into <strong>Technical Links</strong> that provide insights on related threats. They connect the who and the how across hashes (files), malware, malware signatures, MITRE ATT&amp;CK identifiers, internet domain names, IP addresses, network ports, network protocols, URLs, and cyber vulnerabilities (CVEs).</li></ul><h3 id=\"integrating-automating-triage-and-initial-decision-making\">Integrating: Automating triage and initial decision-making</h3><p>Next, integrate the intelligence and context with your organizations security tools: in this case, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/common-siem-problems\">security information and event management (SIEM)</a> tools and <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/supercharging-soar-solutions\">security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)</a> tools. The goal is to replace manual efforts with automatic enrichment of indicators and faster incident response using tools that your security teams already know.To illustrate the anatomy of a threat hunt, well describe the integration between Recorded Futures <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/threat-intelligence\">Threat Intelligence</a> module and <a href=\"https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html\">Splunk Enterprise Security</a>. In this example, a companys security team uses the Recorded Future integration with Splunk Enterprise Security to correlate their own internal telemetry and logs against indicators of compromise (IOCs) that Recorded Future sees as high risk, thus creating a notable event in Splunk Enterprise Security. Through this correlation, the security team is able to identify potentially malicious activity in their own logs that they may have otherwise missed. The integration also automates the process of enriching IOCs with additional context from Recorded Future, including risk score, triggered risk rules and evidence ranked from Unusual to Very Malicious:</p><p><img alt=\"Anatomy of a Threat Hunt 002.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Anatomy_of_a_Threat_Hunt_002_bdecd21dde.png\" /></p><p>Based on the risk score of 96 assigned by Recorded Future, the analyst at this company sends the notable event to  Splunk SOAR to leverage Splunks Adaptive Response framework to kick off automated playbooks.     </p><h3 id=\"analyzing-operationalizing-threat-intelligence-to-hunt-for-malicious-activity-and-exposure\">Analyzing: Operationalizing threat intelligence to hunt for malicious activity and exposure</h3><p>In this example, the companys security teams have created a Splunk SOAR playbook to hunt for threats to the organization based on the previous notable event that was triggered, leveraging context and Technical Links from Recorded Future to make automatic downstream decisions based on intelligence. The playbook incorporates the intelligence and risk score from Recorded Future and weighs them in a decision block</p><p>Since the risk score of 96 falls above the threshold the company has specified, the next step in the playbook is to build lookup table files of all the linked entities, identified through research, including technical sources and findings from Insikt Group, Recorded Futures threat intelligence research arm.</p><p><img alt=\"Anatomy of a Threat Hunt 003.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Anatomy_of_a_Threat_Hunt_003_ff0a98f071.png\" /></p><p>Splunk SOAR can then search the companys Splunk environment for any entities occurring in that lookup table. This step automates the actual hunt by scanning lists, such as firewall logs, for indicators of a threat:</p><p><img alt=\"Anatomy of a Threat Hunt 004.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Anatomy_of_a_Threat_Hunt_004_c09ed57011.png\" /></p><p>If the security teams identify a relevant threat in the environment, Splunk SOAR prompts them with an automated response. Options include adding the IP address to a block list, updating the severity rating of the Splunk SOAR event, and adding a note to the event for future context and research:</p><p><img alt=\"Anatomy of a Threat Hunt 005.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Anatomy_of_a_Threat_Hunt_005_aaa6ee0476.png\" /></p><p>Finally, Splunk SOAR uses a template to generate a notification about the threat:</p><p><img alt=\"Anatomy of a Threat Hunt 006.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Anatomy_of_a_Threat_Hunt_006_b3ca6a6c4d.png\" /></p><p>The notification summarizes and incorporates the intelligence from Recorded Future, including IP address, risk score and linked entities. Splunk SOAR can convey the notification to your threat hunting teams and security operations center (SOC) via email and/or your ticketing platform.</p><h3 id=\"next-step\">Next step</h3><p>This example of monitoring, integrating, and analyzing shows how defenders can unlock the full potential of their data and threat intelligence.

Since at least 2019, RedDelta has been consistently active within Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Vietnam, but has also routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. This is historically evident through the groups targeting of the Vatican and other Catholic organizations in the lead-up to 2021 talks between Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Vatican officials [<a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations\">2</a>], as well as throughout 2022 through the groups shift towards increased targeting of European government and <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european\">diplomatic entities</a> following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>During the 3-month period from September through November 2022, RedDelta has regularly used an infection chain employing malicious shortcut (LNK) files, which trigger a dynamic-link library (DLL) search-order-hijacking execution chain to load consistently updated PlugX versions. Throughout this period, the group repeatedly employed decoy documents specific to government and migration policy within Europe. Of note, we identified a European government department focused on trade communicating with RedDelta command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in early August 2022. This activity commenced on the same day that a RedDelta PlugX sample using this C2 infrastructure and featuring an EU trade-themed decoy document surfaced on public malware repositories. We also identified additional probable victim entities within Myanmar and Vietnam regularly communicating with RedDelta C2 infrastructure.</p><p>RedDelta closely overlaps with public industry reporting under the aliases BRONZE PRESIDENT, Mustang Panda, TA416, Red Lich, and HoneyMyte.</p><h3 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h3><ul><li>RedDelta has consistently conducted long-term cyber-espionage campaigns in line with the strategic interests of the Chinese government, including historical targeting of government and public sector organizations across Asia and Europe as well as overseas organizations associated with minority groups within mainland China such as Tibetan and Catholic Church-related entities.</li><li>Despite the volume of public reporting on the groups activity, RedDelta employs a high operational tempo relative to other state-sponsored actors. The group also maintains a rapid pace of development for its flagship backdoor (remote access trojan [RAT]), a variant of the long-running backdoor PlugX that is heavily customized for anti-analysis for detection evasion.</li><li>In November 2022, RedDelta actors shifted from using archive files to using malicious optical disc image (ISO) files containing a simplified shortcut (LNK) file for delivery of an updated PlugX payload.</li></ul><p><img alt=\"reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant-01.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/reddelta_targets_european_government_organizations_continues_iterate_custom_plugx_variant_01_e20de5f0ec.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: High-level RedDelta TTPs and Recorded Future data-sourcing graphic; historically reported TTPs are shown in gray [<a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations\">2</a>] (Source: Recorded Future)_</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Research (Insikt)", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "2022 Attack Surface Intelligence Product Recap", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "2022 Attack Surface Intelligence Product Recap"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-attack-surface-intelligence-product-recap"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_Main_Feature_e58bcddb6d.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-attack-surface-intelligence-product-recap", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-attack-surface-intelligence-product-recap", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 12, 22, 0, 0, 0, 3, 356, 0], "summary": "Learn about the most exciting product releases for the Attack Surface Intelligence platform.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Learn about the most exciting product releases for the Attack Surface Intelligence platform."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<p>As 2022 draws to a close, we are wrapping up a successful year here at the Recorded Future Attack Surface Intelligence team.</p><p>Our mission is to shine a light on attack surface blind spots by providing an outside-in view of an organization while empowering security teams to prioritize and mitigate risk across their external infrastructure.</p><p>Keeping in mind the multiple geopolitical emerging threats, now, more than ever, having relevant attack surface information delivered at your fingertips is critical in keeping your organization secure.</p><p>Thats why weve focused on delivering new features and updates throughout the year.

This is especially useful when looking at your entire digital inventory, and knowing which assets are impacted by High or Moderate risks.</p><p><img alt=\"2022-1215 Blog -  2022 Attack Surface Intelligence Product Recap feature image-03.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_feature_image_03_6119757822.png\" /></p><h2 id=\"activity-heatmap-and-detailed-application-view\">Activity Heatmap and Detailed Application View</h2><p>This <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/february-product-announcement\">release</a> included:</p><p>The <strong>Activity Heatmap</strong> was added to SurfaceBrowser, initially at /app/sb/domain/[domain]/activity (now available from the Attack Surface Intelligence main menu) to allow users to view all newly observed assets created by day for a given domain while providing a chronological representation of your organization's surface area.</p><p><strong>Detailed Application View</strong>: A new feature of the Attack Surface Intelligence Explorer Screenshots page, this change brings up a window that provides even more detailed information on a given application: screenshots and detected technologies.</p><p><img alt=\"2022-1215 Blog -  2022 Attack Surface Intelligence Product Recap feature image-02.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_feature_image_02_b60c97cda0.png\" /></p><h3 id=\"download-issues-technical-references--more\">Download Issues, Technical References &amp; More</h3><p>In this <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/april-2022-product-updates\">release</a>, we covered the following features:</p><p><strong>Download Issues</strong>: This new option lets you export the entire list of risks in CSV format for offline processing.</p><p><strong>Technical References</strong>: Reference links have been added to some of the most popular risks, including links from different sources, like ExploitDB, NIST, our own Recorded Future, and others.</p><p><strong>Screenshots and Technologies</strong>: On the Risk Rules 'Hosts' tab, for any particular host listed there, you'll find additional screenshots of public vulnerabilities, along with their technologies and open ports.</p><p><img alt=\"2022-1215 Blog -  2022 Attack Surface Intelligence Product Recap feature image-04.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_feature_image_04_1797cf30b7.png\" /></p><h3 id=\"xsoar-integration\">XSOAR Integration</h3><p>The use of security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms has become an essential industry practice in recent years, with market leaders like Cortex XSOAR leading the way in its implementation. So this year, we took yet another pivotal step by <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/xsoar-integration-attack-surface-intelligence\">integrating</a> our Attack Surface Intelligence platform with XSOAR to enrich and contextualize infrastructure risks on the road to improving incident management.</p><p>This integration with Cortex XSOAR works by linking your current Attack Surface Intelligence project within the Cortex XSOAR interface. Analyzing any results takes a few short steps, with features such as an incident overview dashboard going back a given number of days, an event filter according to severity level, or a timeline and similar investigative attributes enabling security teams to gain proper insight into every incident.</p><p><img alt=\"2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_feature_image_03-2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_feature_image_03_2_dcb30d0fe3.png\" /></p><h3 id=\"risk-rules-api-and-the-tines-integration\">Risk Rules API and the Tines Integration</h3><p><strong>The <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/risk-rules-api\">Risk Rules API</a></strong> allows users to extract immediate data from CVEs, including vulnerability name, description, risk severity (classification), affected hostnames, technical references from the Internet, and project metadata such as ID, title, and snapshot creation date.</p><p><img alt=\"2022-1215 Blog -  2022 Attack Surface Intelligence Product Recap feature image-05.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_feature_image_05_926e2ad4a4.png\" /></p><h3 id=\"tines-integration\">Tines Integration</h3><p>In addition to that, <strong>the Tines integration</strong> makes use of all the information available from the Risk Rules API, so you can collect individual risk rules across the Attack Surface Intelligence platform. This will assist your team not only in accessing risk rules data enriched with vulnerability data from Recorded Future, but also in sending quick notifications via Slack to your security team, so they can prioritize and resolve risks accordingly via <a href=\"https://www.tines.com/story-library/74720/fetch-rule-results-from-recorded-future-asi-open-jira-tickets?rel=nofollow,noopener,noreferrer&amp;target=_blank\">Jira</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tines.com/story-library/74735/fetch-rule-results-from-recorded-future-asi-open-servicenow-tickets?rel=nofollow,noopener,noreferrer&amp;target=_blank\">ServiceNow</a> tickets.</p><p><img alt=\"2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_feature_image_011.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1215_Blog_2022_Attack_Surface_Intelligence_Product_Recap_feature_image_011_5570507207.png\" /></p><h3 id=\"exposed-admin-panels\">Exposed Admin Panels</h3><p>This was another handy <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/august-2022-product-updates\">release</a> for Attack Surface Intelligence, covering:</p><p><strong>Admin Panels</strong>, located within the Inventory tab, will help you view administrator panels from popular technologies and software which may be out of compliance adding unnecessary risk to your organization.

Drawing from the concept of personal hygiene in the public health discourse, it is foremost a foundational representation of years worth of empirical data and best practices around the suitable protection of digital systems and personal information. Unfortunately, to many in the field, it is also a complex abstraction laced with implementation deficiencies and hidden strategic costs, always making asset prioritization a subject of debate.</p><p>Some of the most riveting examples of poor cyber hygiene include the failure to encrypt data when required, the mishandling and exposure of Tier 0 assets, or the incorrect implementation of access management policies. Adding to the complicity is the <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/detecting-the-most-dangerous-ports-attack-surface-intelligence\">exposure of databases</a>, vendor-supplied default settings, and ports, which cyber actors can quickly sift out and turn into exploit opportunities.</p><p>As poor or weak institutional cyber hygiene can be envisioned as (essentially) self-inflicted damage, the opposite speaks volumes about the reality that, without a properly functioning cyber hygiene program, these organizations expose themselves to an even greater number of threats than most.</p><h2 id=\"incomplete-asset-visibility\">Incomplete Asset Visibility</h2><p>Inaccurate or incomplete asset inventories can be considered the pinnacle of poor cyber risk management. A <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-23-01\">recent</a> CISA Binding Operational Directive confidently exposes why: precise asset representation is an essential precondition to any modern cyber defense strategy.</p><p>Moreover, with the ever-more-normal and growing presence of cloud-based servicesrolled out and decommissioned at staggering ratesit becomes imperative to avoid the nearby <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/pitfalls-of-incomplete-it-asset-lists\">pitfalls</a> that can quickly hurl your attack surface down an unmanageable path. After all, whats more dangerous than looming vulnerabilities, either inherent or imposed, hiding away in remote corners of your public-facing inventory without the slightest hint of visibility?</p><p>The overarching success of Attack Surface Intelligence is precisely its ability to put this kind of shadow risk at rest once and for all by taking into account cloud asymmetries beyond the simple collection of IP addresses and ports. With such emphasis on <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/mitigate-incomplete-coverage-of-cloud-assets\">context prioritization</a>, organizations can finally fill in the gaps on the road to successful remediation and prevention.</p><h2 id=\"cloud-misconfigurations\">Cloud misconfigurations</h2><p>As the concept implies, <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/cloud-misconfigurations-2022-verizon-dbir\">misconfigured cloud resources</a> refer to the undisciplined administration of either storage buckets, networking components, or credential material responsible for exposing highly-sensitive information to attackers. Using <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/\">Verizon DBIRs</a> parlance, this is where cybercriminals (opportunistic or not) continue to derive substantial profit; in fact, up to 13 percent of all system breaches can be attributed to overly-permissive entitlements across different cloud-based assets, according to the latest report.</p><p>There are a handful of reasons why this happens. On the one hand, theres the sheer misinterpretation of the shared responsibility model, leaving ample room for ambiguity in the implementation of security controls amongst all stakeholders. And lax security controls can only mean one thing: Leaked credentials that allow unauthorized access to an even higher number of systems, leaving entire organizations utterly unaware of the extended risks. Add to this mix the pace at which were building, backed by poor engineering decisions, and the potential for misuse exponentially increases.</p><p>Additional concerns span the domain of containerized apps and any supporting runtime architectures, whose entire lifecycle can include <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/detect-container-orchestration-software-misconfigs\">security risks</a> such as improper access rights at both the OS and application levels, container escape scenarios due to network misconfigurations, or the subversion of software orchestrators leading to systemwide compromise.</p><p>Similarly, with the growing influence of DevOps and the emphasis placed on CI/CD processes, there is a sense of urgency in protecting these from <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/state-of-ci-cd-security#content-the-most-common-cicd-mistakes-that-lead-to-data-breaches-and-network-intrusions\">security risks or neglect</a>namely, those that entail the accidental exposure of sensitive credentials and secrets (often <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/atlassian-confluence-vulnerability-remote-access-hard-coded-pass-cve-2022-26138\">hard-coded</a> and plainly visible), or the misconfiguration of code repositories leading to unauthorized access. Further analysis points to <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/detect-developer-mistakes-before-bad-guys-do\">developer errors</a> signaling unsanitized code and other qualitative mistakes, thus increasing the likelihood of exploitation considerably.</p><h2 id=\"exploited-vulnerabilities\">Exploited vulnerabilities</h2><p>Almost no successful attack exists without some sort of intervening vulnerability. And 2022 is no exception when it comes to the active exploitation of an untold number of cross-cutting CVEs, ranging from the now-infamous Log4J (<a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/log4shell-exploited-how-to-mitigate-damage\">Log4Shell</a>) to ProxyShella spillover duo from 2021 culminating in the likes of Follina (CVE-2022-30190)as well as a handful of zero-days responsible for <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/atlassian-confluence-remote-code-execution-vulnerability\">remote code execution</a> and privilege escalation scenarios across organizations.</p><p>Customer-managed hardware and traffic-shaping appliances have also been at the forefront of the challenge. Recently, federal authorities released an <a href=\"https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX463706/citrix-gateway-and-citrix-adc-security-bulletin-for-cve202227510-cve202227513-and-cve202227516\">advisory</a> detailing three distinct Citrix Gateway and Citrix ADC vulnerabilities, impacting specific network pre-conditions (e.g., SSL VPN), including an authentication bypass labeled as critical with a score of 9.8. Earlier this year, a similar CVE impacting publicly exposed <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/big-ip-application-delivery-services-vulnerability\">F5s BIG-IP</a> management interfaces had already shown signs of abuse by Chinese threat actors by the time the first patches were released.</p><p>Also, in 2022, security researchers were notoriously busy discovering and disclosing a linear progression of high-impact vulnerabilities throughout the open-source ecosystem. For example, cases like <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/openssl-high-severity-vulnerabilities-nov-2022\">CVE-2022-3786 and CVE-2022-3602</a> led to significant upheavals, given OpenSSLs considerable reach within the cryptographic community. Proprietary technologies also had their fair share of high-severity CVEs. As we noted in a <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/zero-day-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities\">previous post</a>, two distinct Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities simulating ProxyShell conditions surprised organizations while spawning a frenzy of possible mitigations and threat-hunting exercises for contingency purposes.</p><p>Finally, as we inch closer to 2023, wed do well to heed CISAs call to action through the use of their <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/detect-and-prioritize-cisas-known-exploited-vulnerabilities\">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities</a> (KEV) catalogan extensive collection of todays top vulnerabilities (either successful or attempted) available to every organization for immediate download and consumption in a variety of formats. Some of these can take many hours to find through other technical means, so the KEV is an invaluable resource to have at hand.</p><h2 id=\"remote-workers\">Remote workers</h2><p>Recognizably so, the year 2020 marked the definitive transition to a new work paradigm bustling with a host of hybrid work alternatives and fully-remote choices, with the safety net that was once the office constituent effectively fading under the new banner of flexibility.</p><p>In the past, weve alluded to the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/remote-attack-surface\">technical and organizational challenges</a> facing businesses when an important part of the workforce goes mobile. For example, weve explored the dangers to privacy and confidentiality posed by public Wi-Fi and similar unprotected networks, the risks presented by <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/rdp-risks-prevention-attack-surface\">exposed RDP endpoints</a>, or the role of financially motivated APT groups in <a href=\"https://therecord.media/chinese-hacking-group-apt31-uses-mesh-of-home-routers-to-disguise-attacks/\">targeting</a> small office/home office (SOHO) routers for botnet-like purposes.</p><p>Lastly, with the welcoming addition of bring your own device (BYOD) alternatives and the use of personal accounts in support of this model, cybercriminals are well placed to take advantage of known techniques to subvert corporate security protections. In a recent case, a Cisco employeewhose Google account had been compromisedgranted unfettered VPN access to a cadre of ransomware groups in a series of attacks that led to these cyber gangs establishing a strong foothold on the internal Cisco network.</p><h2 id=\"final-words\">Final words</h2><p>Undoubtedly, corporate information and technology services across the globe are currently under a wave of cybercrime. Compounding the problem is an ever-increasing availability of a veritable arsenal of exploit and attack tools at the disposal of practically everyone, forcing organizations to redouble efforts to minimize repercussions of a broader scale.</p><p>But whether the threat comes from the human side or the computing side, the reality is that, as the attack surface widens in both scope and complexity, cybercriminals continue to be disproportionately ahead of the game in terms of organization and resources; a technical slant now famously accounting for the bulk of advanced threats worldwide.</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "2022 Adversary Infrastructure Report", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "2022 Adversary Infrastructure Report"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_333ba903c2.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 15 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 12, 15, 0, 0, 0, 3, 349, 0], "summary": "Where will threat actors spin up malicious infrastructure in 2023?

All data was sourced from the Recorded Future Platform and is current as of September 1, 2022.</p><h4 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h4><p>Recorded Future tracks the creation and modification of new malicious infrastructure for a multitude of post-exploitation toolkits, custom malware, and open-source remote access trojans (RATs). Since <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/threat-identification.pdf\">2017</a>, we have created detections for 108 families including RATs, advanced persistent threat (APT) malware, botnet families, and other commodity tools. We observed over 17,000 unique command-and-control (C2) servers during 2022, which is up 30% from last year. Much like 2021, our collection in 2022 was dominated by Cobalt Strike team servers, botnet families including IcedID and QakBot, and popular RATs such as PlugX.</p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>32% of detected servers (5,481 servers) were identified exclusively by Recorded Futures <a href=\"https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024113434-Security-Control-Feed-Command-and-Control\">Command-and-Control</a> source.</li><li>We observed an average of a 33-day lead time between when a C2 server is detected by our scanning efforts and when it is reported in other sources.</li><li>The overall number of detected C2 servers increased by 30% from 13,629 in 2021 to 17,233 in 2022.</li><li>PlugX remains in heavy use despite ShadowPad being touted as its successor.</li><li>Much like in 2021, botnet malware, mainly Emotet and QakBot, have continued to expand their C2 infrastructure and remain prevalent throughout the year.</li><li>Shifts in Russian state-sponsored C2 infrastructure can make tracking specific operations more difficult than with other state-attributed entities.</li><li>The largest hosting providers continue to have the most C2 server observations, as expected. However, there have been shifts in which providers are being used for C2 servers, including a more than 300% increase in hosting on Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems that made it the most popular for C2s in our survey, with China overtaking the US as the top country by volume for C2 server-hosting.</li><li>In 2021, we predicted a more diverse C2 environment where we would see an increase in detections from new tooling. However, the variety we observed came more from a broader spread of established tooling rather than from the use of new tools.</li></ul><h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4><p>Increasing notification lead time in the identification of soon-to-be activated malicious command-and-control (C2) servers can help defenders more proactively neutralize threats. Before a C2 server can become operational, there are several steps a threat actor needs to take as seen in Figure 1. First, the server infrastructure has to be acquired, either via compromise or legitimate purchase. Next, if a domain name is required for C2 communications, it will have to be acquired and registered. Then, the software must be installed, configurations tuned, transport layer security (TLS) certificates registered (if applicable), and files added to the server. The actors must access it via panel login, secure shell (SSH), or remote desktop protocol (RDP), and then expose the malware controller on a port to allow the data to transfer from the victim and to administer commands to infections. (Depending on the operation, additional actions may also be required.) Only after these steps are completed can the server be used maliciously.</p><p><img alt=\"2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_1_8b2d7ab820.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1: C2 Weaponization Lifecycle (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><p>However, in standing up, configuring, and accessing the server, the adversary leaves behind artifacts that are observable prior to the use of the server in a phishing campaign or with a malicious tool. These artifacts create detection opportunities for defenders, and include software versions deployed on the server, the login panel, TLS certificate patterns, or the default message returned by a simple probe.</p><p>Detecting C2 servers from creation to weaponization provides insight into how adversaries conduct malicious campaigns. This includes: </p><ul><li>Comparing C2 detections to reports of intrusions related to those families can identify how many intrusions are caught and potentially how many events remain unknown in the public domain.</li><li>Measuring the tempo of server creation can provide insight into forthcoming surges or drawdowns of activity.</li><li>Capturing indicators and intelligence otherwise unavailable in the public domain.</li></ul><h5 id=\"a-note-on-collection-bias\">A Note on Collection Bias</h5><p>Recorded Future collects information about C2 servers based predominantly on traits from known malware families and their server-side software. The nature of this collection is focused on identifying known command-and-control frameworks and their derivatives or support infrastructure and includes passive and active internet scan data. We only verify that an IP address is a C2 server with proof of malicious activity from the C2. Therefore, we will be biased in reporting servers of known threats, and have a collection bias towards those servers. This methodology should not act as a replacement for identifying anomalies or detecting odd traffic inside a network.</p><h4 id=\"threat-analysis\">Threat Analysis</h4><p>Our top 5 C2 family observations are not dominated by any one malware category and instead have a mix of post-exploitation frameworks (Cobalt Strike), remote access tools / backdoors (PlugX, DarkComet), and botnets (Emotet).</p><p><img alt=\"2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_2_e6a44a1eab.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 2: 3-year trends for top 5 C2s observed by Recorded Future (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><p>A closer look at the top 5 families over the last 3 years shows the continuous rise in the number of Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter and PlugX servers we identified, despite the age of these tools. Our detection for Emotet has been active for about a year, and based on the number of detections we have observed, Emotet is indeed <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/e/bruised-but-not-broken--the-resurgence-of-the-emotet-botnet-malw.html\">back</a> in full operation. DarkComet remains relevant as evidenced by its increase of ~47% over the prior year. New malware and red-teaming tools are released every year; however, we observe less usage of them as compared with entrenched tools of the prior generation, as seen in Figure 2.</p><p><img alt=\"2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_3.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_3_a669698bf7.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 3: Total C2 detections by malware family as seen by Recorded Future (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><p>When expanding the scope into the top 20 C2 detections we see a more well-rounded C2 environment including new families, such as Brute Ratel (BRc4) and BumbleBee alongside mainstays such as PlugX, AsyncRAT, IcedID and DarkComet. In 2021, we predicted that the C2 environment will continue to diversify. As new malware families and C2 frameworks are released, we anticipate a portion of them will be aware of threat intelligence measures to scan and detect their servers. While it is true that in 2022 we have observed a significant increase in the number of C2s we detected for tools outside last years top 5 and top 20, most of the increase this year is due to the use of established tooling such as PlugX, Remcos, DarkComet, and QuasarRAT by a wider array of actors. The top 6 tools in our data set with increased usage in 2022 as compared with 2021 were:</p><ol><li>PlugX (51% increase)</li><li>Remcos (51% increase)</li><li>DarkComet (44% increase)</li><li>QuasarRAT (40% increase)</li><li>Mythic (33% increase)</li><li>AsyncRAT (24% increase)</li></ol><p>We believe this high level of commodity tool use indicates that an increasing percentage of threat actors are more concerned with blending in and being non-attributable rather than being undetectable, or have simply determined that their targets are not likely to detect even these well-known tools. Additionally, considering the cost and expertise required to develop bespoke tooling, threat actors may prefer buying commodity tools or using free open-source tools. </p><p>For example, use of BRc4 will provide more endpoint detection and response (EDR) evasion techniques, but poses more risk to attribution due to its smaller user base, whereas use of DarkComet may not be as stealthy or evasive but is an open-sourced RAT that is used by many threat actors.</p><h5 id=\"2022-adversary-infrastructure-themes\">2022 Adversary Infrastructure Themes</h5><p>When looking at our C2 observations as a whole, we identified 3 top themes for 2022:</p><ol><li>PlugX Remains Successful, in Spite of Its Successor: PlugX is still widely used, despite ShadowPad being touted as its successor.</li><li>Back to Bots (Again and Again): While not quite as prevalent as in 2021, multiple botnets are still very active; Emotet, IcedID, QakBot, Dridex, and TrickBot all made the top 20 in 2022.</li><li>Russia, Burn after Reading: The limitations of Russia-attributed C2 detections.</li></ol><h6 id=\"plugx-remains-successful-in-spite-of-its-successor\">PlugX Remains Successful, in Spite of Its Successor</h6><p>In our 2020 Adversary Infrastructure report, we referenced an article from Doctor Web that <a href=\"https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14048&amp;lng=en\">described</a> ShadowPad as the successor to PlugX. We continued to observe PlugX infections after 2020, despite the increased adoption of ShadowPad by multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups (Recorded Future tracks the infrastructure that administers ShadowPad controllers as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE). In 2022, usage of PlugX continues and has even increased as shown in the graph below.</p><p><img alt=\"2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_4.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_4_e7643e2cc7.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 4: Count of PlugX and AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE C2s detected over the past 12 months (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><p>PlugX has been used by primarily China-based threat actors over the past decade. A builder for an earlier PlugX variant was leaked publicly as <a href=\"https://www.cyber.airbus.com/latest-changes-plugx\">reported</a> by Airbus in 2015. This indicates that PlugX usage is likely less-closely controlled compared to ShadowPad, which is <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/shadowpad-a-masterpiece-of-privately-sold-malware-in-chinese-espionage\">likely</a> privately sold to a limited set of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors. We actively track PlugX variants attributed to the RedDelta and RedFoxtrot threat actor groups.</p><h6 id=\"back-to-bots-again-and-again\">Back to Bots (Again and Again)</h6><p>In 2021 we saw a sharp increase in botnet activity after the Emotet takedown, with TrickBot, QakBot, Bazar, IcedID, and Dridex representing the majority of the C2s we detected. In 2022, while botnets did not dominate our C2 data, they were still present in our top 5 and top 20 lists. As shown in Figure 5, Dridex, Emotet, IcedID, QakBot, and TrickBot are the botnet families we observed with the most C2 detections this year.</p><p><img alt=\"2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_5.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_5_b3e03dfabd.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 5: Comparison of detected Dridex, Emotet, IcedID, QakBot, and TrickBot C2s (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><p><strong>TrickBot and Dridex</strong><br />We observed a spike in the number of TrickBot C2s detected in October 2021 (194 active C2s) before the malware went dormant a few months later; similarly, Dridex activity remained steady, ranging from 45 to 80 active C2s per month until a spike in June 2022 (150 active C2s), prior to going dormant.</p><p>The TrickBot activity aligns with <a href=\"https://intel471.com/blog/trickbot-2022-emotet-bazar-loader\">reporting</a> at the start of this year noting that TrickBot operators are phasing out the use of the TrickBot malware. For Dridex, the increased use in March up to the spike in June correlates with <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/rig-exploit-kit-replaces-raccoon-stealer-trojan-with-dridex\">reporting</a> of Dridex being used in RIG exploit kits. The sudden dormancy of Dridex could also be indicative of the botnet being surpassed overall due to the prevalence of IcedID and QakBot, and the resurrection of <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2021/11/trickbot-helps-emotet-come-back-from-the-dead\">Emotet</a>.</p><p><strong>QakBot</strong><br />The number of QakBot C2s observed was relatively low at the end of last year and into this year, with an average 10 active C2s per month. Starting in March 2022, we have observed a significant increase in the number of QakBot C2s detected, with the highest being 90 active C2s in September 2022. Most recently, SentinelOne has seen QakBot being used to <a href=\"https://assets.sentinelone.com/sentinellabs22/SentinelLabs-BlackBasta\">deliver</a> Black Basta ransomware.</p><p><strong>IcedID</strong><br />Up until May 2022, we have observed IcedID having anywhere from 30 to 60 active C2s per month. Starting in May we see an increase up to 102 and a further steady increase to 178 active C2s in September 2022. The following key events may be contributing factors to these increases:</p><ul><li>In April 2022, <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/39609\">CERT-UA</a> sent an advisory about a mass distribution of XLS documents that install the IcedID malware.</li><li>Most recently, IcedID has <a href=\"https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs.-quantum-locker-ransomware\">reportedly</a> been used to download and execute Quantum Locker ransomware.</li></ul><p><strong>Emotet</strong><br />After the <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action\">takedown</a> of Emotet infrastructure in early 2021 and a long break in activity, there was speculation that Emotet may cease operations permanently; this proved to be incorrect. Emotet returned in late 2021, <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/who-is-behind-the-comeback-of-emotet\">reportedly in coordination</a> with the Conti ransomware operation. Emotets early resurgence was <a href=\"https://de.darktrace.com/blog/emotet-resurgence-cross-industry-campaign-analysis\">reported</a> to be a reuse of TrickBots infrastructure. Coincidentally, in Figure 5, we can see Emotet starts off with the same number of active C2s we tracked for TrickBot right before the latter ceased operations.</p><p>Although the volume of Emotet C2s was relatively low in late 2021 and early 2022, we observed a major spike in May 2022 with over 1,200 active C2s. Reporting from Netskope Threat Labs mentions 2 active campaigns in this timeframe that were using <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/emotet-new-delivery-mechanism-to-bypass-vba-protection\">LNK</a> files and <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/emotet-still-abusing-microsoft-office-macros\">Microsoft Office documents</a> to spread Emotet.</p><p>In June the numbers returned to a low range until July 2022, at which time Emotet numbers began rising again. The number of active Emotet C2s observed at present are almost to the level of the surge seen in May, with just over 1,000 active C2s in September 2022. The recent uptick in Emotet active C2s since July 2022 supports the most recent reporting on Emotet:</p><ul><li>Emotet is being used to <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-now-pushes-quantum-and-blackcat-ransomware\">load</a> Quantum and ALPHV ransomware.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-fall-2022-return?utm_source=social_organic&amp;utm_social_network=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=ThreatInsight&amp;utm_post_id=24bea24f-c51b-43ec-aa5e-22035ece837b\">Proofpoint</a> stated that Emotet is distributing hundreds of thousands of phishing emails a day in November, and is being used to load and execute IcedID. Increased distribution of IcedID via Emotet may also contribute to the recent uptick in our IcedID detections.</li></ul><h6 id=\"russia-burn-after-reading\">Russia, Burn after Reading</h6><p>Based on our observations, Russian state-attributed actors often use better operational security for C2 infrastructure when compared with other state-sponsored operations. For instance, they often use methods such as operating C2 servers on a 1-to-1 basis, thus only interacting with implants at a single target organization. We also observe that when their C2 infrastructure is publicly reported upon, it is often quickly dispensed with. Some Russian state-sponsored actors have also been <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign\">at the forefront</a> of the overall trend of state actors shifting toward <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/russia-nexus-uac-0113-emulating-telecommunication-providers-in-ukraine\">usage of commodity malware</a> and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/solardeflection-c2-infrastructure-used-by-nobelium-in-company-brand-misuse\">popular C2 frameworks</a>. Threat actors taking advantage of common, off-the-shelf software for espionage operations can make attribution more difficult for researchers and investigators.</p><p>In contrast, operations attributed to China, Iran, and some other states are often incautious with their malware and infrastructure operational security, using specific C2s for numerous targets and after public disclosure, or using what is essentially the same malware (such as PlugX) for years while sharing it among multiple operational teams.</p><p>Frequent shifts in Russian state-sponsored C2 infrastructure can make tracking specific operations more difficult. GRAVITYWELL, the Recorded Future designation for server technology and TLS certificate configuration commonly used to host the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)-linked WellMess backdoor, provides an example of such transient infrastructure.</p><p>We have tracked GRAVITYWELL through multiple phases. Between these phases, we have observed distinct shifts in infrastructure soon after public disclosures of GRAVITYWELL activity.</p><p>In July 2020, the UKs National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) published a <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development.pdf\">report</a> on APT29 operations using WellMess. The report included the C2 infrastructure known to be in use in the campaign. In August 2020, that infrastructure was replaced with a new set of C2s, identifiable by TLS certificate patterns that were distinct from the previous phase of the campaign. In July 2021, a <a href=\"https://community.riskiq.com/article/541a465f/indicators\">RiskIQ report</a> was released that identified more than 30 C2 servers that provided TLS certificate details. As happened a year earlier, changes in those C2s were observed within a month of the reports release.</p><p><img alt=\"2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_6.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_figure_6_bdc1f2aed7.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 6: Timeline of GRAVITYWELL public reporting and Infrastructure changes (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><h6 id=\"post-exploitation-frameworks\">Post-exploitation Frameworks</h6><p>It is difficult to estimate what percentage of any of the post-exploitation frameworks we detected are used in legitimate red-teaming operations, and which are used by criminal or espionage elements.

Cobalt Strike is clearly the preferred offensive security tool for an array of actors, and Cobalt Strike detection volume increased significantly last year. We attribute the 2-fold increase to the multitude of detections, the length of time those detections have been running, and the volume of actors using Cobalt Strike.</p><p>Other frameworks in our top 10 with increased volume include Covenant, Mythic, and Metasploit/Meterpreter (these 2 were combined this year); however, none of them jumped as significantly as Cobalt Strike. Covenants <a href=\"https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant\">open-source</a> project has not been updated since 2021, but continues to see an uptick in usage. Mythic continues to receive <a href=\"https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic\">updates</a> to its code base. Some Mythic infrastructure references the name <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benkow_/status/1542047469860683777\">Botleggers Club</a>, which is also <a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/mythic-case-study-assessing-common-offensive-security-tools\">mentioned</a> in the Conti Leaks, suggesting that at least some ransomware operators were using it.</p><p>Both Brute Ratel (BRc4) and BeEF are honorable mentions this year as their detection rates were not yet high enough to make it into the top 10. The developer behind BRc4, who has a <a href=\"https://0xdarkvortex.dev/about\">background in EDR development</a>, strives to make the tool harder to detect by specifically targeting the way EDRs work to avoid detection. A version of BRc4 has been <a href=\"https://www.sans.org/blog/cracked-brute-ratel-c4-framework-proliferates-across-the-cybercriminal-underground\">cracked</a> and is spreading through the criminal underground as well, and has been <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/j/black-basta-infiltrates-networks-via-qakbot-brute-ratel-and-coba.html\">seen</a> in use by the Black Basta ransomware gang.</p><h4 id=\"global-scale\">Global Scale</h4><p>We detected 30% more C2 servers in 2022 (17,233) as compared with 2021 (13,268) as a result of: the development of detections for new malware families; improvements in detections for existing malware families; and increased use of tools we have detections for such as Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter, and PlugX.</p><p>We observed the creation of C2 infrastructure on 1,419 hosting providers across 116 different countries.

While we expect Cobalt Strike to remain in our top 5 detections for next year, we do not predict to see another 2-fold increase. We believe that Cobalt Strike usage will be cannibalized by BRc4 usage. As a result, we predict that BRc4 usage and C2 detections will increase, due to threat actors moving to use BRc4 because it aims to be less detectable by EDR agents and serves as a capable alternative to Cobalt Strike. It is also conceivable that there will be an increase in C2 observations associated with niche C2 tools such as Sliver, DeimosC2, Alchimist, and Manjusaka.</p><p>We are already seeing malware families such as Redline Stealer, QakBot, and Nanocore be successful despite their use of random and non-standard ports. This prohibits traditional, full internet scanning as it is not feasible to scan all possible non-standard ports across the IPv4 space. While once thought to be easier to detect, the use of high ports seems to still be an adequate C2 communication channel, and we predict that more C2 operators will make use of high ports for their C2 communication.</p><p>In June of 2022, ShadowServer detailed their <a href=\"https://www.shadowserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Internet-Spelunking-FIRST-2022-Public.pdf\">methodology</a> for scanning the IPv6 internet space. We predict that more organizations, including Recorded Future, will increase IPv6 scanning with resulting findings of more IPv6 C2 detections. While not widely reported on, malware that communicates over a IPv6 connection does exist, such as VirtualPie as <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/esxi-hypervisors-malware-persistence\">reported</a> on by Mandiant.</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "The 2022 Adversary Infrastructure Report", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "The 2022 Adversary Infrastructure Report"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2022-1215.pdf"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_adversary_infrastructure_report_cover_4e6e11efdf.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2022-1215.pdf", "id": "https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2022-1215.pdf", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 15 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 12, 15, 0, 0, 0, 3, 349, 0], "summary": "Where will threat actors spin up malicious infrastructure in 2023?

It focuses specifically on advertisements, posts, and interactions on Chinese-language dark web marketplaces and cybercrime-related Telegram channels. It also takes into consideration the effect of Chinese laws and regulations on data security and cybercrime in China. This report is a follow-up to our previous reporting in 2021 on Chinas cybercrime landscape and Chinese cybercrime in neighboring countries. It will be of greatest interest to organizations and geopolitical analysts seeking to understand the cybercriminal underground in order to better monitor security-related threats, as well as to those researching the Chinese-language underground.</p><h4 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h4><p>As China has continued to pass cybersecurity laws that give greater control to the state, this has inversely affected cybercrime as the companies that are usually targeted are being required to better secure personally identifiable information (PII) data. Nonetheless, PII data (of both Chinese nationals and international entities) is still being widely compromised and sold on dark web marketplaces, special-access forums, and Telegram channels. Furthermore, new laws banning cryptocurrency trading, the tightening of banking regulations, and a renewed crackdown on telecommunications (telecom) and online fraud continue to make it tougher for cybercriminals to operate in China. As a result, cybercriminals have moved their operations abroad and devised novel ways to weaponize PII data to perpetrate fraudulent activities.</p><p>We analyzed new Chinese-language dark web marketplaces that have emerged in the past year as well as popular Chinese-language Telegram channels devoted to cybercrime. We surveyed Chinese- and Taiwanese-related PII and access offerings on English- and Russian-language special-access forums and analyzed how they could provide initial access to ransomware threat actors. We also examined some unique scams in the Chinese cybercrime landscape and how they could be traced back to aforementioned dark web marketplace offerings. Finally, we provided some analysis on how geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan might shape cross-strait cyber conflicts in the coming years. </p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>The enactments of Chinas Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and Data Security Law (DSL) signal that the Chinese government is serious about data security. The banning of cryptocurrency trading, mining, and advertisement, new regulations against money laundering, and new laws to combat telecom and online fraud are making it increasingly challenging for cybercriminals to operate in China as well as in neighboring countries. </li><li>Chinas drive toward a digital economy enabled by big data has opened up the attack surface for hackers and leaves data vulnerable, resulting in several high-profile data breaches leading to exposures of large numbers of PII data during the past year. It is highly likely that threat actors have harvested and analyzed big sets of data, organizing and parsing them into smaller sets of data that contain more specific groups and individuals in order to monetize them through cybercriminal sources.</li><li>Despite the challenges noted above, Chinese-language dark web marketplaces continue to evolve, with new ones emerging to replace older ones that have gone offline. Telegram also serves an important role in the Chinese cybercrime scene, as it has been used to complement dark web marketplaces with threat actors who often advertise data sets and vice activities on their Telegram channels. </li><li>As more leaked data from foreign countries appear on Chinese-language dark web marketplaces and more Chinese/Taiwanese data and access are posted on popular English- and Russian-language criminal sources, the national borders are increasingly blurred for cybercriminals.</li><li>Chinese cybercriminals have become more organized in their transnational operations as they devise innovative ways to weaponize personally identifiable information (PII) to conduct fraud via sophisticated spearphishing schemes.</li></ul><h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4><p>Our previous reporting on the Chinese cybercrime landscape covered the Chinese-language dark web markets, clearnet hacking forums and blogs, and messaging platforms. We analyzed the features of these sources and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Chinese-speaking threat actors within the context of their distinct cultural, political, and legal characteristics. In our reporting on Chinese cybercrime in neighboring countries, we uncovered the trend of well-resourced Chinese cybercrime syndicates moving their operations abroad, especially to Southeast Asian countries where the laws are more relaxed, which has enabled them to perpetuate fraud (such as online romance scams using the CryptoRom malware) on a global scale. As China marches toward a digital economy and enacts new laws and regulations to tighten data security and crack down on telecom fraud and cybercrimes, the environment becomes increasingly challenging for cybercriminals. However, new socioeconomic and technological developments present opportunities for cybercriminals who are constantly updating their TTPs to survive and thrive in the new landscape.</p><h4 id=\"threat-analysis\">Threat Analysis</h4><h5 id=\"laws-and-regulations-affecting-the-chinese-cybercriminal-landscape\">Laws and Regulations Affecting the Chinese Cybercriminal Landscape</h5><p>In this section, we summarize various laws and regulations that went into effect during the past year that have a direct impact on the Chinese cybercriminal landscape, specifically the collection and storage of PII data by private companies, the Chinese government's continued crackdown on crypto use and mining, and laws designed to stymie activities that facilitate fraud and criminality.</p><h6 id=\"the-enactments-of-pipl-and-dsl\">The Enactments of PIPL and DSL</h6><p>On November 1, 2021, Chinas Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-new-personal-data-privacy-law-take-effect-nov-1-2021-08-20\">passed</a> by the National Peoples Congress on August 20, 2021, went into effect. The PIPL is seen as the Chinese equivalent of the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and was expected to add more compliance requirements for companies in the country. The Chinese government has instructed its tech giants to ensure better secure storage of user data, amid public complaints about mismanagement and misuse that have resulted in user privacy violations. The law stated that handling of personal information must have clear and reasonable purpose and shall be limited to the &quot;minimum scope necessary to achieve the goals of handling&quot; data. It also laid out conditions companies must abide by to collect personal data, including obtaining an individual's consent, and it also laid out guidelines for ensuring data protection when data is transferred outside the country. The law further called for handlers of personal information to designate an individual in charge of personal information protection, and also called for handlers to conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the law. The implementation of PIPL came after the passage of the Data Security Law (DSL), which came into effect on September 21, 2021, and set a framework for companies to classify data based on its economic value and relevance to China's national security. Together, PIPL and DSL provide 2 major regulations for governing China's internet in the future.</p><h6 id=\"didi-fined-for-data-security-violations\">Didi Fined for Data Security Violations</h6><p>On July 21, 2022, Chinas internet regulator fined ride-hailing giant Didi $1.2 billion for its voracious data collection policies and lackluster security protections around sensitive user information.</p><p>The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said it had concluded a network security review of the company and found illegal activities and violations of the countrys network security laws (DSL and PIPL). The fine was the largest data protection penalty ever issued by China, and the second-largest fine imposed on a Chinese technology firm after regulators slapped Alibaba with a $2.75 billion fine last year following an anti-monopoly probe.</p><p>The CAC said that during its investigation of Didi, which began in 2021, it found 16 violations that included the illegal collection of nearly 12 million users photo albums, 107 million facial recognition profiles of passengers, and significant amounts of users PPI data. According to Chinese regulators, Didi kept millions of sensitive user records unencrypted, causing national security risks.</p><p>The companys app was also collecting excessive information on its drivers and often asked for device permissions that allowed widespread access to users devices. A spokesperson for the CAC criticized the company for having inaccurate and unclear descriptions of why it needed the information it was collecting.</p><p>The CAC said it plans to intensify its enforcement of cybersecurity and data protection laws in the coming years.</p><h6 id=\"the-banning-of-cryptocurrency-mining-trading-and-advertisement-and-the-introduction-of-digital-yuan\">The Banning of Cryptocurrency Mining, Trading, and Advertisement, and the Introduction of Digital Yuan</h6><p>While China has <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/china-crypto-bans-a-complete-history\">maintained</a> a hostile relationship with the cryptocurrency industry since 2013, the latest crackdowns in 2021 were seen as the most severe. Citing concerns related to its effect on the climate, the State Council began <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/bitcoin-falls-as-china-calls-for-crackdown-on-crypto-mining-trading\">calling</a> for restrictions on crypto mining and trading in May 2021. Following the statement, provincial governments such as Inner Mongolias began to take proactive measures to eradicate crypto mining. As a result, miners in those regions were either forced to shut down permanently or to move to other crypto-friendly countries. In August 2021, the CAC <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3188280/china-sweeps-12000-crypto-related-social-media-accounts-fresh-clean\">ordered</a> social media platforms to terminate 12,000 accounts that were promoting cryptocurrency in the name of financial innovation. The purged accounts spanned multiple platforms including Weibo, Baidu, and WeChat. It also shut down 105 websites that ran tutorials for cryptocurrency buying and selling. In September 2021, Chinese authorities ordered a fresh round of crackdowns on crypto mining and outlawed virtually all crypto trading activities.</p><p>In early 2022, the Chinese Central Bank issued the digital yuan (also <a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/lets-start-with-what-chinas-digital-currency-is-not\">known</a> as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), e-Renminbi (e-RMB), and e-CNY), which was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/perspectives/china-digital-yuan-cryptocurrency-bitcoin/index.html\">piloted</a> in various Chinese cities during the second half of 2021 and made its global debut at the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022. It is a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that relies on blockchain technology to conduct transactions but is centrally controlled by regulatory authorities and backed up by fiat currency reserves. And unlike cryptocurrency, which offers a great deal of privacy and anonymity, the digital yuan gives the government unprecedented visibility into transactions as they have direct access to the data. It can also be made programmable so that the government can issue or cut off payments. 10 countries have already <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker\">launched</a> a CBDC and many more are considering it.</p><p>All Chinese-language dark web markets operate on cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Tether, and Ethereum. As detailed later in the dark web marketplace section, while we observed a number of such marketplaces going offline, new ones emerged to take their place. As a result of both government crackdowns in China and the issuance of the digital yuan, cryptocurrency trading will be pushed further into the underground and increasingly conducted on dark web marketplaces.</p><h6 id=\"regulations-to-combat-money-laundering\">Regulations to Combat Money Laundering</h6><p>A new regulation designed to combat money laundering was issued by Chinas central bank and was scheduled to take effect on March 1, 2022. However, it was <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3167951/china-delays-new-anti-money-laundering-rules-amid-privacy\">postponed</a> due to technical reasons.</p><p>The new regulation requires people who make a single cash deposit or withdrawal that exceeds 50,000 yuan ($6,904 USD), or $10,000 USD in a foreign currency, to report the source and intended use of the money. Banks and other licensed financial institutions handling relevant transactions must also validate and store clients information, according to the joint order issued last month by the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC), the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.</p><p>Critics of the regulation claimed that it will effectively infringe on individual property rights by giving financial institutions the power to restrict deposits and withdrawals at their discretion, and may also mute capital flows and impede Chinas economic recovery. Together with the ban on cryptocurrency trading, this new regulation makes it harder for cybercriminals inside of China to cash out their earnings.</p><h6 id=\"law-enforcement-on-telecom-and-online-fraud\">Law Enforcement on Telecom and Online Fraud</h6><p>On September 2, 2022,(Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Combating Telecom and Online Fraud) was passed during the 36th session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC), and is set to take effect in December 2022.</p><p>The law was passed as telecom and online fraud grew more rampant in China during the past decade. The South China Morning Post <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3191195/china-passes-new-law-tackle-growing-telecoms-and-online-fraud\">reported</a> that in recent years, criminals have illegally obtained victims information through advanced telecom network technologies and taken advantage of loopholes in management, and that this activity has become so rampant that it has posed serious threats to public security and social stability. Criminal syndicates have reportedly become better organized, with clear divisions of labor, and are able to conduct activities across multiple countries with the intention to scam people in China. </p><p>The law <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3191195/china-passes-new-law-tackle-growing-telecoms-and-online-fraud\">places</a> major responsibility for anti-fraud security on telecom business operators, banking and financial institutions, non-bank payment institutions, and internet service providers. These organizations are expected to establish internal risk prevention, controls, and security systems. The law will be applicable both within and outside Chinese territory, and overseas organizations or individuals who conduct telecom network fraud activities will be held accountable in accordance with the relevant provisions of this law. </p><p>The law stipulates that the Chinese foreign and public security ministries must work more closely with international law enforcement agencies to crack down on these crimes. The law empowers the police to impose travel restrictions on suspects who frequently visit hotspot countries and regions, particularly Southeast Asian countries, unless they can provide valid reasons for their travel to such areas. Ex-offenders may also be subject to travel bans for as long as 3 years after completing their jail sentences.</p><h5 id=\"the-drive-toward-big-data-and-major-data-breaches\">The Drive toward Big Data and Major Data Breaches</h5><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/big-data#:~:text=Big%20data%20is%20high%2Dvolume,decision%20making%2C%20and%20process%20automation.\">definition</a> by Gartner, big data is high-volume, high-velocity, and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation. </p><p>According to The Brookings Institution, many arms of the Chinese government have been <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-china-harnesses-data-fusion-to-make-sense-of-surveillance-data\">collecting</a> huge volumes of data for surveillance purposes, which authorities refer to as visualization () and police informatization (). Chinas data-fusion programs allow its surveillance systems to assemble highly detailed information of its citizens. The Chinese government makes use of data-fusion tools to monitor, collect, and store information of individuals classified as focus personnel, which includes individuals petitioning the government, those purportedly involved in terrorism, and those deemed by the Chinese government to be undermining social stability. These data-fusion tools have also helped to build predictive policing systems in Xinjiang, Brookings notes, helping to accurately depict terrorists religious, organizational, and behavioral characteristics.</p><p>Excessive monitoring, collecting, and storing of sensitive information belonging to individuals is not illegal under Chinese law. Under Article 28 and 33 of the Personal Information Protection Law of the Peoples Republic of China, the law allows for state organs, such as the Chinese police force, to handle sensitive information, and the scope and limits of what type of data the Chinese government can collect and/or store legally are up to the state organs to decide. The types of information involved include biometric identification, religious beliefs, PII, medical care, financial accounts, individual whereabouts, and other information, as well as the personal information of minors under the age of 14.</p><p>The development of the big data industry was also seen as a <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/14th-five-year-plan-for-the-development-of-the-big-data-industry\">key</a> aspect of the 14th Five-Year-Plan period [2021-2025] as Chinas industrial economy moves toward a digital economy. The big data industry had an average compound annual growth rate of over 30% during the 13th Five-Year Plan period [2016-2020]. New requirements were proposed for the development of the big data industry to allow it to enter a new phase of integrated innovation, rapid development, in-depth applications, and structural optimization. The drive toward big data was further accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, security is unable to catch up with the rapid growth of data collection, as evidenced by some high-profile data breaches reported during the past year. Threat actors have managed to obtain large volumes of data that contain extremely sensitive information, and then analyzed and repackaged these data sets into smaller data sets that have been resold on both Chinese- and non-Chinese-language cybercriminal sources.</p><h6 id=\"data-breaches-of-beijing-and-shanghai-health-code-apps\">Data Breaches of Beijing and Shanghai Health Code Apps</h6><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has required its citizens to use an app on their smartphones that acts as an e-passport to dictate whether they should be allowed in public or be quarantined. The app was first heralded by the local government of Hangzhou with the help of Ant Financial, a sister company of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. The app generates a QR code in 1 of 3 colors: a green code enables its holder to move about unrestricted; a yellow code means the holder may be asked to stay home for 7 days; and a red code means a 2-week quarantine. An <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html\">analysis</a> of the apps software code by the New York Times showed that in addition to determining in real-time whether someone poses a contagion risk, the app also shared the users information with the police, raising privacy concerns. According to Maya Wang, a China researcher from Human Rights Watch, China has a record of using major events, including the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, to introduce new monitoring tools that outlast their original purpose. Maya Wang also added that The coronavirus outbreak is proving to be one of those landmarks in the history of the spread of mass surveillance in China.</p><p>In addition to privacy concerns, poor security in the databases associated with the health code apps had led to 2 well-publicized data breaches, described below.</p><p>On April 28, 2022, Wei Bin, an official from the Beijing municipal government, disclosed that Beijing Jiankangbao (), a mobile-based app used to check health codes and provide nucleic acid testing results during the COVID-19 pandemic, was allegedly attacked by overseas hackers. &quot;The Beijing Jiankangbao was attacked on Thursday morning during its peak visiting period. The team of technicians fixed the problems swiftly&quot;, Wei said at a news conference, adding, &quot;We later found out the source of the attack was from overseas&quot;. Wei claimed that the app was also attacked by overseas hackers during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. To date, we have not seen data from the app being offered on dark web marketplaces or forums.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, XJP, a member of the mid-tier BreachForums, was selling data from 48.5 million unique users of  (Suishenma), the Shanghai equivalent of the Beijing health code that was compromised earlier this year. The Suishenma health code was <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3188746/shanghai-health-code-system-containing-personal-data-485-million\">developed</a> by the Shanghai Big Data Center, an agency under the Shanghai Municipal Government, in early 2020 to help local authorities manage the COVID-19 outbreak. It became an essential digital tool in the daily lives of Shanghai residents, who were required to show a green code before being allowed to take public transport or to go into public venues. The threat actor XJP claimed the database contained everyone who lived in or visited Shanghai since the adoption of the Shuishenma app, and shared a screenshot of the data sample. The database was priced at $4,850, which was later reduced to $4,000. XJP uses Matrix (breach.co:XJP) as their primary method of contact. The post was listed as verified, and XJP authorized pompompurin, the administrator of BreachForums, to conduct the trade of this database on the threat actors behalf. While many comments to the post indicated interest in the database, most of them thought it was too expensive, even at the reduced price. It is interesting to note that the post used the Chinese characters  (instead of the correct ) to indicate the health code app, which suggested that XJP might not be a native Chinese speaker. On September 9, 2022, XJP also offered to sell data from Chinas Border Exit and Entry Management Bureau that reportedly contained information on people who have crossed Chinese borders between July 2020 and July 2022. The threat actor stated that the database contains more than 240 million records, but that it may be incomplete and may not include data about diplomatic visits. The database was priced at $100,000. The credibility of XJP is moderate: the threat actor has authored 5 threads and 20 posts since registering their account in July 2022 and has a positive reputation score of 92, at the time of this report.</p><p><img alt=\"restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_1_427697fd0c.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1: XJP selling QR health codes belonging to 48.5 million residents in Beijing, China (Source: BreachForums)</strong></p><h6 id=\"shanghai-police-database-breach\">Shanghai Police Database Breach</h6><p>On July 3, 2022, news reports emerged regarding a data leak of 23 TB of personal information from the Shanghai National Police on Chinese citizens, posted by the user ChinaDan on BreachForums. According to <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/breach-07152022152546.html\">Radio Free Asia</a>, the leaked database was most likely hosted by Alibaba Cloud. As <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hacker-claims-have-stolen-1-bln-records-chinese-citizens-police-2022-07-04\">reported</a> by Reuters, Zhao Changpeng, CEO of Binance, said on July 4, 2022, that the cryptocurrency exchange had stepped up its user verification processes after the company's threat intelligence detected the sale of records belonging to 1 billion residents of an Asian country on the dark web, mostly likely referring to the BreachForums posting by ChinaDan.</p><p>Recorded Future has obtained the sample data shared by ChinaDan, and can confirm that the data includes full names, home addresses, birthplaces, national ID Numbers, mobile numbers, and crime/case details that date from as far back as 1995 to as recent as 2019. Our preliminary assessment of the data sample indicates that the data appears to be authentic. However, given the purported size of the data package, it is impossible to ascertain whether the entire package is what it is advertised to be.</p><p><img alt=\"restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_2_ccdad41541.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 2: ChinaDan selling the Shanghai Police databases on BreachForums; the owner of BreachForums pompompurin has verified the database to be legitimate (Source: BreachForums)</strong></p><h6 id=\"chinese-database-storing-millions-of-faces-vehicle-license-plates-left-exposed-online\">Chinese Database Storing Millions of Faces; Vehicle License Plates Left Exposed Online</h6><p>On August 30, 2022, TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/30/china-database-face-recognition\">reported</a> that a Chinese database that stored millions of faces and vehicle license plates was left exposed on the internet for months before it quietly disappeared in August 2022. The database, which reportedly held over 800 million records at its peak, belonged to a tech company called Xinai Electronics based in Hangzhou. The company builds systems for controlling access for people and vehicles at workplaces, schools, construction sites, and parking garages. Xinai Electronics had amassed millions of face prints and license plates through its network of cameras all over China, and claimed its data was securely stored on its servers.</p><p>The exposed data on an Alibaba-hosted server in China was found by security researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hak1mlukha\">Anurag Sen</a>, who asked TechCrunch for help in reporting the security lapse to Xinai. Sen reported that neither the database nor the hosted image files were protected by passwords and could be accessed from the web browser by anyone who knew where to look. After several emails by TechCrunch notifying Xinai about the exposed database without replies, the database became inaccessible by mid-August 2022.</p><p>While we did not identify any postings on cybercriminal markets that directly mention this database, advertisements for car-owner information are often found on Chinese-language dark web marketplaces. For example, we found this posting of detailed information about General Motors car owners in China. We cannot ascertain if the data offered here came from the exposed database mentioned above, as it is a common practice for Chinese threat actors to parse large leaked databases into smaller sizes based on certain attributes in order to monetize it more easily.</p><h5 id=\"ddos-attacks-and-hacktivism-surrounding-pelosis-visit\">DDoS Attacks and Hacktivism Surrounding Pelosis Visit</h5><p>On August 3, 2022, the United States (US) House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan and met with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan (Republic of China). Pelosi <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/08/03/pelosi-meets-tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-president\">declared</a> that the US will not abandon our commitment to Taiwan and Tsai said Taiwan would &quot;never back down&quot; in the face of threats. Throughout the day on August 2, 2022, and into August 3, 2022, China continued its strong warnings against Speaker Pelosis visit and took political, military, and economic actions aimed at punishing Taiwan and deterring further US support for Taiwan. On August 4, 2022, The Record by Recorded Future <a href=\"https://therecord.media/taiwan-defense-ministry-says-ddos-incident-briefly-took-down-network-after-pelosi-visit\">reported</a> that Taiwans Ministry of National Defense said its network was taken offline by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) incident for about 2 hours following Speaker Pelosis visit to the island; the attack started shortly after Pelosi left the island. The Record article states that Chinese government officials were furious about the visit  the first by a high-ranking US official in 25 years  arguing that it violated the countrys one China policy. In a statement, Taiwans Ministry of National Defense said the DDoS attacks began around 23:40 and ended around 00:30 (Taipei time). The ministry said it was working with other agencies and the presidents office to defend the governments information security infrastructure. The attack came after several websites run by the government of Taiwan, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the Taoyuan International Airport, were disrupted ahead of Pelosis visit.</p><p>The attacks were large enough to make the websites inaccessible for brief periods, but were not particularly large in scale. ISC Sans and other cybersecurity organizations <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/28906\">suggested</a> the DDoS attacks were likely the work of nationalist hacktivists in China rather than Chinas formal civilian or military cyber forces.</p><p>Despite the lack of evidence for any large-scale government-sponsored cyberattacks, John Hultquist of Mandiant still <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/03/those-pelosi-inspired-cyberattacks-taiwan-probably-werent-all-they-were-cracked-up-be\">expected</a> Chinas cyber espionage to kick into overdrive as its government seeks to learn what the US is thinking, what the limits of our resolve are, and stated that the way you find answers to that are by reading emails of diplomats and military members and government leaders.</p><p>We did not find any direct mentions of DDoS attacks against Taiwan on the Chinese-language underground. However DDoS tools, tutorials, and services are often advertised on Chinese-language cybercriminal marketplaces. Anyone interested can easily acquire the tools and knowledge to pull off a small-scale attack.</p><h5 id=\"changes-in-the-dark-web-markets\">Changes in the Dark Web Markets</h5><p>Since our last report on the Chinese cybercrime landscape in 2021, there have been noticeable changes in the makeup of dark web marketplaces. Several of the marketplaces have gone offline, including Loulan City Market, Tea Horse Road Market, Ali Marketplace, and Dark Web Exchange. However, some of the accompanying Telegram channels for these marketplaces continue to operate. There could be a number of reasons for these dark web marketplaces going offline, which include but are not limited to law enforcement actions, exit scams, and internal disagreement between threat actors.</p><p>Marketplaces that are still operating at the time of this report include the Exchange Market, FreeCity Market, Alibaba Market, and United Chinese Escrow Market (UCEM). Meanwhile, 3 new dark web marketplaces have emerged and are still in operation at the time of this report: Dark Web Chinese Market, Tengu Market, and ChangAn Sleepless Night. Below are the descriptions of each of these 3 new marketplaces.</p><h6 id=\"dark-web-chinese-market\">Dark Web Chinese Market</h6><p>The earliest post on the Dark Web Chinese Market was from September 2021. Registration for the marketplace is free and listings are divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Paid Advertisement (no listings under this section at the time of this report)</li><li>Data: Various stolen data including PII, carding material, and more</li><li>Tutorials: Hacking techniques, social engineering, fraud schemes, and more</li><li>Physical Items: Mostly sets of 4 IDs (standard for bank account access in China) for bank account access</li><li>Videos: Mostly adult content</li><li>Virtual Items: Carding tutorials, templates for counterfeit documents, and more</li><li>Software Websites: Various legal and illegal software, SMS receiving services, and more</li></ul><p>There were 700 items for sale at the time of this report, with postings listed in US dollars as well as Bitcoin (BTC). A for-sale posting has information including the number of items sold, the rating of the item, and the time the item was posted. The information of the seller is completely anonymized (no handle for the seller is provided) for the sake of privacy protection.</p><p>The transaction escrow period is 5 days, as any transaction is automatically confirmed after 5 days. If an extension is needed, a user needs to specify stop automatic payment from the system on the order form. If delivery is delayed for more than a day from the seller, the buyer can request a refund and note the reason. If there is a dispute in the transaction, each party has 3 days to address the request. The party that does not reply in 3 days will lose the arbitration automatically. Due to the anonymous nature of the website, no administrator is identified based on available information.</p><p><img alt=\"restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_3.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_3_d8dc4a1fd4.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 3: The landing page for Dark Web Chinese Market (Source: Dark Web Chinese Market)</strong></p><h6 id=\"tengu-market\">Tengu Market</h6><p>The earliest seller registration on Tengu Market was dated from March 2022. Registration for the marketplace is free and listings are divided into the following categories (verbatim):</p><ul><li>BTC-Related: coin mixing services, cryptocurrency wallets without lost passwords, password crackers for wallets, and more</li><li>Databases: email addresses with passwords, US drivers licenses, blackhat search engine optimization (SEO) tutorials, and more</li><li>Physical Stuff: cell phone cards, counterfeit watches, and more</li><li>Entertainment: various types of games and software</li><li>Online-SMS: Google voice numbers and other SMS receiving services</li><li>Geek-Tech: remote access trojans (RATs), hacking tools and tutorials, and more</li><li>Mysterious: carding materials and other tutorials</li><li>Gift Cards: PayPal account numbers and passwords</li></ul><p>There were about 60 postings at the time of this report, with postings listed in US dollars even though BTC is the only type of currency accepted. A for-sale posting has information including the number of items sold and remaining, the rating of the item, as well as the sellers handle and rating. Each sellers page has ratings in the categories of quality, communication, and delivery. The website charges a 7% processing fee for each transaction. After an order is placed on an item listed, if no payment is received after 5 hours, the transaction is automatically canceled. The website also offers arbitration for any disputed transactions. In addition, the website appears to have an associated chat room and Telegram channel. There does not appear to be a website administrator; however, the chat room has a member with the handle , which is the Chinese word for administrator.</p><p><img alt=\"restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_4.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_4_b8b70a6542.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 4: The landing page for Tengu Market (Source: Tengu Market)</strong></p><h6 id=\"changan-sleepless-night\">ChangAn Sleepless Night</h6><p>The earliest post on ChangAn Sleepless Night was from December 2021.

Some items are also listed in Tether (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH). A for-sale posting has information including the number of items sold, the number of views, the handle of the seller, and the last time the seller was online. The marketplace offers escrow service, and transactions outside the website are discouraged. If an item purchased is not sent 3 days after payment, or if there is a dispute after the transaction, if the seller does not respond after 3 days, the transaction can be suspended by the buyer while notifying the administrator. After verification by the administrator, the cost of the transaction will be refunded to the buyer and the item will be taken offline. A certain percentage of the transaction proceeds will be deducted as a processing fee for website maintenance. The official Telegram channel of the market is @cabyc and the administrator can be contacted anonymously using the messaging service on the website or via Telegram at @ganmao.</p><p><img alt=\"restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_5.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_5_b127688f61.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 5: The landing page for ChangAn Sleepless Night (Source: ChangAn Sleepless Night)</strong></p><p>Below are some observations on the new developments on Exchange Market since our last report.</p><h6 id=\"greater-competition-from-chinese-threat-actors-on-exchange-market\">Greater Competition from Chinese Threat Actors on Exchange Market</h6><p>2022 proved to be a popular time for Chinese threat actors to compete against the well-known Chinese threat actor 302513, who has a moderate credibility on the Exchange Market, having more than 100 posts on leaked data affecting international entities since the relaunch of Exchange Market in Q4 2019. 302513 has indicated in their listings that reports have already been lodged against more than a dozen sellers, and that these sellers are recycling and reselling the data they bought from 302513. 302513 claims that other database sellers simply created new listings and resold the databases on the Exchange Market platform.</p><p>We observed that Exchange Market does not have any rules that clamp down on individuals that repackage and resell the data sets found in the platforms listings. The platform lacks a protection mechanism for sellers like 302513, which has been hurting the financial profits of long-time database sellers. Such an observation also shows that Exchange Market is slowly evolving to become a more recognized platform for Chinese-speaking threat actors to market their database listings. As time goes by, we expect that more financially motivated threat actors will join Exchange Market and sell databases involving multiple countries and industries.</p><p><img alt=\"restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_6.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/restrictive_laws_push_chinese_cybercrime_toward_novel_monetization_techniques_figure_6_2609a1006e.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 6: Exchange Market seller 302513 complaining about other Chinese threat actors recycling 302513s data and reselling it on Exchange Market; the threat actor has lodged reports against more than a dozen sellers (Source: Exchange Market)</strong></p><h5 id=\"chinese-language-telegram-channels-devoted-to-cybercrime\">Chinese-Language Telegram Channels Devoted to Cybercrime</h5><p>As stated earlier, some Telegram channels accompanying dark web marketplaces continue to operate even after those marketplaces have gone offline. Meanwhile, there are many independent Chinese-language channels that engage in carding, fraud, leaked data, and other illicit activities. While some of these channels initially disallow advertising, over time many channels, especially ones associated with dark web marketplaces, appear to be overrun by advertisements. The tables below list some of the Telegram channels associated with dark web marketplaces as well as ones that operate independently. The nature of these publicly accessible channels are mostly self-explanatory from their names.

We examined some of the more unique frauds perpetrated by Chinese threat actors and identified that in almost all cases there were novel ways to utilize PII data that were sold and circulated on cybercriminal sources. We identified evidence that threat actors have weaponized compromised PII by devising sophisticated social engineering and spearphishing schemes in which they impersonate Chinese officials and well-known corporate entities to scam individuals both within and beyond Chinese borders.</p><h6 id=\"chinese-illegal-lending-practices-and-connections-to-the-dark-web\">Chinese Illegal Lending Practices and Connections to the Dark Web</h6><p>In March 2021, the South China Morning Post <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3127483/multi-billion-dollar-criminal-lending-scheme-resulted-89-deaths\">reported</a> that a multi-billion-dollar criminal lending scheme resulted in 89 deaths in China.

An unlicensed money-lending gang headed by a man named Wang Tao inked 3.36 million contracts with 475,000 people between March 2018 and March 2019. The illegal enterprise lured unsuspecting borrowers with enticing terms such as interest-free for seven days or low threshold, fast loans in contracts that often resulted in annual interest rates of between 1,303 percent to 5,214 percent if the borrower could not pay off their debt quickly. The gang also hired 24 debt collection companies that harassed, threatened, and intimidated victims and their family members for a commission. Authorities say this intimidation directly resulted in some victims taking their own lives.</p><p>We found evidence from dark web marketplaces that threat actors have sold the PII of Chinese individuals with credit issues, and that the buyers of such data are highly likely to be related to loan sharks.

As these fintech companies were unlikely to get fresh NBFC licenses from the Reserve Bank of India, Chinese digital loan companies colluded with existing NBFCs to indulge in large-scale lending activities. Indian authorities found that various fintech companies in collusion with NBFC have indulged in predatory lending, charged exorbitant interest rates, imposed harsh penalties for late payment, operated illegally, and employed heavy-handed collection strategies. These Chinese apps would seek permission to access the victims contacts, which were later used for all sorts of blackmail by the company.

Chinese-speaking threat actors would typically call Chinese citizens living outside of China, often posing as law enforcement officers. The scammers would accuse the victims of having committed crimes and would often threaten them with jail terms. They would then usually persuade the victims to pay money to help to avoid investigations and jail sentences.</p><p>In the case study cited in the AsiaOne article, the scammer called a 16-year-old Chinese national living in Singapore and accused him of spreading COVID-19 rumors in China and of being involved in smuggling offenses. When the victim refuted the accusations, the caller told the victim that his mother might have given his personal data to malicious actors who committed those crimes using his identity, and that the mainland Chinese police would call him shortly after for further investigations. When the fictitious Chinese police called the victim, the scam caller told the victim that his mother was involved in money laundering and was asked to stage a hostage situation to convince her to confess. The victim eventually gave in, filmed himself as a hostage, and sent the video to his mother for ransom payment in exchange for the victims safe return to China.</p><p>Another similar case occurred in October 2022 that involved a Hong Kong university professor who was <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3194829/university-professor-hong-kong-conned-out-nearly-hk4\">swindled</a> out of nearly HK$4 million. In this case, the scammer accused the victim of flouting COVID-19 quarantine rules overseen by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau and of being involved in a money laundering case in mainland China, which required him to submit personal particulars, including his Bank of China account details, to the scam syndicate to prove his innocence. The fictitious investigators successfully used fear and extortion tactics to transfer a total of HK $3.84 million over the course of 3 months.</p><p>We believe that these types of scams may work due to the large amount of PII data being sold that sometimes contains the PII of both students and their parents, along with data sets for Chinese nationals living abroad.

Bulk messaging software is also used to send text messages masked as notices. According to a <a href=\"https://safeguarddefenders.com/sites/default/files/pdf/INvoluntary%20Returns.pdf\">report</a> published by Madrid-based rights group Safeguard Defenders, China has forced nearly 10,000 Chinese living overseas suspected of corruption and financial crimes to return through covert and often illegal means including intimidation, threats, and even state-sanctioned kidnappings. According to a September 2022 <a href=\"https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/230000-policing-expands\">report</a> by Safeguard Defenders, the Chinese government has <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/chinas-secret-police-invaded-american-shores-human-rights-advocate?intcmp=tw_fnc\">established</a> at least 54 police-run overseas police service centers across 30 different countries, including the US, which have issued government documents stating that relatives in China that do not help police &quot;persuade&quot; targets to return to China should be investigated and punished by the police.</p><p>Recorded Future believes that victims who fall prey to such sophisticated phishing, smishing, or vishing scams are genuinely afraid of Chinese law enforcement forcibly repatriating them back to China for alleged financial crimes. A 2015 Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardlevick/2015/01/21/new-data-bribery-is-often-an-unspoken-rule-in-china/?sh=4ce5f9c579c6\">article</a> claims that bribery is often an unspoken rule in China, where many companies pay bribes or give gifts in order to operate. It is also widely known in China, as seen in a March 2021 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/04/947943087/how-chinas-massive-corruption-crackdown-snares-entrepreneurs-across-the-country\">article</a> by NPR, that it is possible to pay your way out, which refers to bribing Chinese officials to help individuals avoid persecution or to lessen criminal charges. Chinese cybercriminals likely leveraged the threat of forced repatriation based on financial crimes, the bribing culture, and the compromised PII of Chinese nationals living overseas, in order to successfully impersonate Chinese law enforcement officials and scam victims. Scam phone calls are usually well planned and sophisticated; the scam caller usually knows significant details of the victims PII such as full names, ID card numbers, home addresses in China, overseas addresses, occupations, as well as information belonging to family members. Possession of these details helps the scam callers to instill fear in their victims and to convince victims to give in to the scammers demands, as it can be extremely hard for the overseas Chinese national to determine whether or not the call is from a legitimate Chinese authority.</p><p>Chinese nationals living overseas are often targeted due to the perception that they are generally affluent if they are able to live in First World countries such as the US, Singapore, Canada, Japan, Germany, and other countries that have a much higher cost of living than China. Many wealthy Chinese are already <a href=\"https://mothership.sg/2022/09/wealthy-chinese-move-singapore\">moving out of China</a> to countries like Singapore due to Chinas growing political rhetoric of common prosperity and going after the entrepreneurs, and also in response to severe COVID-19 lockdowns.</p><h6 id=\"crypto-romance-scams-targeting-women\">Crypto Romance Scams Targeting Women</h6><p>In June 2022, the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b325b37a-ae62-4af1-ba56-568598d2dbe7\">reported</a> that crypto swindlers preyed on ethnic Chinese women looking for love, in scams where fraudsters establish online romances before duping victims of their life savings. Fraudulent actors will usually create fake websites that mimic the names of real exchanges, such as KrakenCoin and Coinbase CCY. These websites have 24/7 online customer service and charts showing live coin price fluctuations, and would initially allow the unsuspecting women to withdraw some assets into fiat currency, duping them into trusting the platform. This type of scam is also known as a pig butchering scam, which affects both males and females.</p><p>In August 2022, the CAC <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3188280/china-sweeps-12000-crypto-related-social-media-accounts-fresh-clean\">ordered</a> the removal of 12,000 crypto-related websites and social media accounts for promoting cryptocurrencies. Social media accounts from multiple platforms including Weibo, Baidu, and WeChat were shut down, along with 105 websites that promoted and ran tutorials on buying, selling, and mining digital assets. The Financial Regulatory Bureau of Shenzhen warned in June 2022 that cryptocurrency bred criminal activities and disrupted financial order, and cautioned investors against participating in illegal financial activities and potentially being scammed.</p><p>We found evidence on the Chinese dark web that threat actors have listings that contain records of PII belonging to females; cryptocurrency scammers could exploit this data and devise scam tactics and strategies to use against the women whose PII have been compromised.</p><table>  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style=\"width: 125px; background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">Type of PII</td>      <td style=\"width: 375px; background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">Intelligence</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Female Data from Dating Site</td>      <td>On May 11, 2022, 565231, a member of Exchange Market, advertised 7,000 records of PII from female users of the Chinese dating website zhenai[.]com for $700.

President Xis speech to party cadres suggests that he intends to firmly <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/01/zero-covid-china-economic-problems-demographics\">implement</a> the zero-COVID policy, which has already seen negative economic and social costs. With increasing economic hardship and <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/china/2022/10/13/china-shows-few-signs-of-loosening-its-zero-covid-policy\">high levels of youth unemployment</a> (close to 20%), China is currently seeing a <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3183909/chinas-internet-watchdog-ramps-crackdown-online-scams-amid-growing\">growing trend</a> of online scams, particularly tens of thousands of counterfeit financial services applications meant to dupe consumers for financial gain, and will continue to clamp down on these activities and criminal gangs with tougher new legislations. The slowing economic growth and widespread discontent will likely drive disenfranchised youth into cybercrime due to lack of economic opportunities. We also expect the majority of lower-level Chinese threat actors to continue to conduct cyberattacks against Chinas domestic industries including healthcare, financial, government, and education entities for financial gain. More resourceful threat actors will move their cyber operations abroad or focus more on foreign data/access to diversity their portfolio, recruiting foreign cybercriminals to participate in cyberattacks against global entities. </p><p>Despite the heated rhetoric and warnings, no large-scale cyberattacks took place during US Speaker Pelosis visit to Taiwan. There were only low-level DDoS attacks likely attributed to patriot hacktivism. However, President Xi vowed to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-age-of-Great-China/Xi-Jinping-s-37-year-plan-for-Taiwan-reunification\">never renounce</a> the use of military force to take control of Taiwan, which will inevitably cause greater tensions with the US and with Taiwan. Although China <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3198210/china-has-no-time-frame-taiwan-reunification-even-if-us-says-so-envoy\">denied</a> the existence of any timeline for reunification with Taiwan, the recent reshuffling of military leadership <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3196962/chinas-reshuffled-military-leadership-sends-clear-signal-taiwan-focus\">clearly indicated</a> a focus on Taiwan in the next 5 years and beyond. However, Russias lack of military success in the invasion of Ukraine, coupled with the near-unanimous international condemnations and sanctions following the invasion, will serve as a warning to China should it consider conducting a military invasion of Taiwan. We believe that a large-scale military conflict is unlikely to take place, but that cyber warfare is likely, involving the deployment of Chinas cyberwarfare units and the possible assistance of Russian and North Korean threat actors in targeting, disrupting, or destroying entities deemed vital to the US and its allies, primarily with regard to the semiconductor industry.</p><p>On October 28, 2022, Chinas State Council announced that China will construct a national integrated government big data system. Data available to the government will also be <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/31/china_government_big_data_system\">expanded</a> to include information on electronic licenses, medical and healthcare, emergency management, and credit systems, and to incorporate them into the national integrated government affairs big data system. An integrated big data system can be considered a gold mine in the eyes of cybercriminals, and we expect threat actors to attempt to breach the new big data system as well as to target other state organs that hold sensitive data, and to use data-fusion pools to analyze and break down the data sets into smaller data sets that could be weaponized against individuals. These smaller data sets are highly likely to contain information that appeal to criminal gangs, such as those involved in illegal lending practices as well as syndicates that conduct scams by impersonation of government officials.</p><p>We also believe that some Chinese companies might purchase data sets containing criminal records as a form of background check before hiring individuals. There is also the possibility of Chinese citizens with past criminal records having their data compiled and posted on websites for people interested in doing open-source background checks, which will affect the socio-economic outlook of these individuals. There is also the possibility of threat actors manipulating the data of ex-offenders by tweaking records found in breached data sets, which can result in negative consequences such as having people with no past criminal records being included in data sets containing records of ex-offenders, which will affect their chances of getting hired.</p><p>The Chinese governments push for an integrated system for their political and economic objectives will likely come with negative consequences, allowing the cybercriminal landscape to evolve and thrive with more threat actors devising new and innovative methods to weaponize or even manipulate PII to serve the needs of other criminal gangs and organizations in the event of future data breaches.</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "What is Threat Intelligence?", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "What is Threat Intelligence?"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/threat_intelligence_definition_1_dd05d92813.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence", "guidislink": false, "published": "Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 346, 0], "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<h2 id=\"what-is-threat-intelligence-in-cybersecurity\">What Is Threat Intelligence in Cybersecurity?</h2><p>Digital technologies lie at the heart of nearly every industry today.

Additionally, the attack surfaces organizations have to understand and protect are bigger now than ever before. Threats arent coming from one angle, organizations need to understand business risk from cyber attacks, physical security and operational disruptions, attacks on their reputation, and more.</p><p>Some organizations try to incorporate <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-feeds/\">threat data feeds</a> into their network, but dont know what to do with all that extra data, adding to the burden of analysts who may not have the tools to decide what to prioritize and what to ignore.</p><p>A threat intelligence solution can address each of these issues. The best solutions use a combination of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-graph-retrospective\">machine learning</a> to automate data collection and processing, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/integrations\">integrate with your existing solutions</a>, take in unstructured data from disparate sources, and then connect the dots by providing context on indicators of compromise (IoCs) and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors.</p><p>Threat intelligence is actionable  its timely, provides context, and is able to be understood by the people in charge of making decisions.</p><h2 id=\"who-can-benefit-from-threat-intelligence\">Who Can Benefit From Threat Intelligence?</h2><p>All security &amp; risk teams and leaders! Threat intelligence is widely imagined to be the domain of elite analysts. In reality, it adds value across <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/cyber-threat-intelligence-team\">security functions for organizations of all sizes.</a></p><p>When threat intelligence is treated as a separate function within a broader security team rather than an essential component that augments every other function, the result is that many of the people who would <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-business-benefits\">benefit the most from threat intelligence</a> dont have access to it when they need it.</p><p>Security operations teams are routinely unable to process the alerts they receive  threat intelligence integrates with the security solutions you already use, helping automatically prioritize and filter alerts and other threats. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-management-prioritization\">Vulnerability management</a> teams can more accurately prioritize the most important vulnerabilities with access to the external insights and context provided by threat intelligence. And fraud prevention, risk analysis, and other high-level security processes are enriched by the understanding of the current threat landscape that threat intelligence provides, including key insights on threat actors, their tactics, techniques, and procedures, and more from data sources across the web.</p><p>Look at our section on use cases below for a deeper look at how every security role can benefit from threat intelligence.<br /><br /></p><h2 id=\"the-cyber-threat-intelligence-cycle\">The Cyber Threat Intelligence Cycle</h2><p>So, how does threat intelligence get produced? Raw data is not the same thing as intelligence  threat intelligence is the finished product that comes out of a six-part cycle of data collection, processing, and analysis. This process is a cycle because new questions and gaps in knowledge are identified during the course of developing intelligence, leading to new collection requirements being set. An effective intelligence program is iterative, becoming more refined over time.</p><p>To maximize the value of the threat intelligence you produce, its critical that you identify your <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-use-cases/\">use cases</a> and define your objectives before doing anything else.</p><h3 id=\"1-planning-and-direction\">1. Planning and Direction</h3><p>The first step to producing actionable threat intelligence is to ask the right question.</p><p>The questions that best drive the creation of actionable threat intelligence focus on a single fact, event, or activity  broad, open-ended questions should usually be avoided.</p><p>Prioritize your intelligence objectives based on factors like how closely they adhere to your organizations core values, how big of an impact the resulting decision will have, and how time sensitive the decision is.</p><p>One important guiding factor at this stage is understanding who will consume and benefit from the finished product  will the intelligence go to a team of analysts with technical expertise who need a quick report on a new exploit, or to an executive thats looking for a broad overview of trends to inform their security investment decisions for the next quarter?</p><h3 id=\"2-collection\">2. Collection</h3><p>The next step is to gather raw data that fulfills the requirements set in the first stage. Its best to collect data from a wide range of sources  internal ones like network event logs and records of past incident responses, and external ones from the open web, the dark web, and technical sources.</p><p>Threat data is usually thought of as lists of IoCs, such as malicious IP addresses, domains, and file hashes, but it can also include vulnerability information, such as the personally identifiable information of customers, raw code from paste sites, and text from news sources or social media.</p><h3 id=\"3-processing\">3. Processing</h3><p>Once all the raw data has been collected, you need to sort it, organizing it with metadata tags and filtering out redundant information or false positives and negatives.</p><p>Today, even small organizations collect data on the order of millions of log events and hundreds of thousands of indicators every day. Its too much for human analysts to process efficiently  <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-graph\">data collection and processing has to be automated</a> to begin making any sense of it.</p><p>Solutions like SIEMs are a good place to start because they make it relatively easy to structure data with correlation rules that can be set up for a few different use cases, but they can only take in a limited number of data types.</p><p>If youre collecting unstructured data from many different internal and external sources, youll need a more robust solution. Recorded Future uses machine learning and natural language processing to parse text from millions of unstructured documents across seven different languages and classify them using language-independent ontologies and events, enabling analysts to perform powerful and intuitive searches that go beyond bare keywords and simple correlation rules.</p><h3 id=\"4-analysis\">4. Analysis</h3><p>The next step is to make sense of the processed data. The goal of analysis is to search for potential security issues and notify the relevant teams in a format that fulfills the intelligence requirements outlined in the planning and direction stage.</p><p>Threat intelligence can take many forms depending on the initial objectives and the intended audience, but the idea is to get the data into a format that the audience will understand. This can range from simple threat lists to peer-reviewed reports.</p><h3 id=\"5-dissemination\">5. Dissemination</h3><p>The finished product is then distributed to its intended consumers. For threat intelligence to be actionable, it has to get to the right people at the right time.</p><p>It also needs to be tracked so that there is continuity between one <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-lifecycle-phases/\">intelligence cycle</a> and the next and the learning is not lost. Use ticketing systems that integrate with your other security systems to track each step of the intelligence cycle  each time a new intelligence request comes up, tickets can be submitted, written up, reviewed, and fulfilled by multiple people across different teams, all in one place.</p><h3 id=\"6-feedback\">6. Feedback</h3><p>The final step is when the intelligence cycle comes full circle, making it closely related to the initial planning and direction phase. After receiving the finished intelligence product, whoever made the initial request reviews it and determines whether their questions were answered. This drives the objectives and procedures of the next intelligence cycle, again making documentation and continuity essential.</p><h2 id=\"the-types-of-threat-intelligence\">The Types of Threat Intelligence</h2><p>As demonstrated by the intelligence lifecycle, the final product will look different depending on the initial intelligence requirements, sources of information, and intended audience. It can be helpful to break down threat intelligence into a few categories based on these criteria.</p><p>Threat intelligence is often broken down into three subcategories:</p><ul><li><strong>Strategic</strong>  Broader trends typically meant for a non-technical audience</li><li><strong>Tactical</strong>  Outlines of the tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors for a more technical audience</li><li><strong>Operational</strong>  Technical details about specific attacks and campaigns (sometimes also called <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/technical-threat-intelligence/\">technical threat intelligence</a>)</li></ul><h5 id=\"as-more-types-of-threats-converge-security-professions-need-to-adapt-their-playbook-learn-more-in-our-upcoming-webinar-the-convergence-of-threats-how-to-stay-ahead-of-cyber-and-physical-adversaries\">As more types of threats converge, security professions need to adapt their playbook. Learn more in our upcoming webinar <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/threat-convergence-webinar\">The Convergence of Threats: How to Stay Ahead of Cyber and Physical Adversaries</a></h5><h2 id=\"tactical-threat-intelligence\">Tactical Threat Intelligence</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/tactical-threat-intelligence/\">Tactical threat intelligence</a> outlines the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors. It should help defenders understand, in specific terms, how their organization might be attacked and the best ways to defend against or mitigate those attacks. It usually includes technical context, and is used by personnel directly involved in the defense of an organization, such as system architects, administrators, and security staff.</p><p>Stakeholders and consumers of tactical threat intelligence can include:</p><ul><li>SOC Analysts</li><li>IT Analysts</li><li>Vulnerability Management Teams</li><li>Security Architects (for integrations)</li></ul><p>Reports produced by security vendors are often the easiest way to get tactical threat intelligence. Look for information in reports about the attack vectors, tools, and infrastructure that attackers are using, including specifics about what vulnerabilities are being targeted and what exploits attackers are leveraging, as well as what strategies and tools that they may be using to avoid or delay detection.</p><p>Tactical threat intelligence should be used to inform improvements to existing security controls and processes and speed up incident response. Because many of the questions answered by tactical intelligence are unique to your organization, and need to be answered on a short deadline  for example, Is this critical vulnerability being exploited by threat actors targeting my industry present in my systems?  having a threat intelligence solution that integrates data from within your own network is crucial.</p><h2 id=\"operational-threat-intelligence\">Operational Threat Intelligence</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/operational-threat-intelligence\">Operational intelligence</a> is knowledge about cyber attacks, events, or campaigns. It gives specialized insights that help incident response teams understand the nature, intent, and timing of specific attacks.</p><p>Stakeholders and consumers of operational threat intelligence can include:</p><ul><li>Security Leaders</li><li>SOC Managers</li><li>Threat Hunters </li><li>Cyber Threat Intelligence Teams</li><li>Incident Responders</li></ul><p>Because this usually includes technical information  information like what attack vector is being used, what vulnerabilities are being exploited, or what command and control domains are being employed  this kind of intelligence is also referred to as <strong>technical threat intelligence</strong>. A common source of technical information is threat data feeds, which usually focus on a single type of indicator, like malware hashes or suspicious domains.</p><p>But if technical threat intelligence is strictly thought of as deriving from technical information like threat data feeds, then technical and operational threat intelligence are not totally synonymous  more like a Venn diagram with huge overlaps. Other sources of information on specific attacks can come from closed sources like the interception of threat group communications, either through infiltration or breaking into those channels of communication.</p><p>Consequently, there are a few barriers to gathering this kind of intelligence:</p><ul><li><strong>Access</strong>  Threat groups may communicate over private and encrypted channels, or require some proof of identification. There are also language barriers with threat groups located in foreign countries.</li><li><strong>Noise</strong>  It can be difficult or impossible to manually gather good intelligence from high-volume sources like chat rooms and social media.</li><li><strong>Obfuscation</strong>  To avoid detection, threat groups might employ obfuscation tactics like using codenames.</li></ul><p>Threat intelligence solutions that rely on <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/machine-learning-cybersecurity-applications/\">machine learning processes for automated data collection</a> on a large scale can overcome many of these issues when trying to develop effective operational threat intelligence.

Its intended to inform high-level decisions made by executives and other decision-makers at an organization  as such, the content is generally less technical and is presented through reports or briefings. Good strategic intelligence should provide insight into areas like the risks associated with certain lines of action, broad patterns in threat actor tactics and targets, and geopolitical events and trends.</p><p>Stakeholders and consumers of strategic intelligence can include:</p><ul><li>C-Suite (CISO, CIO, CSO, CTO) </li><li>Board Members </li><li>Senior VPs</li><li>Intelligence Leaders (Cyber and Physical)</li></ul><p>Common sources of information for strategic threat intelligence include:</p><ul><li>Policy documents from <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threats/state-sponsored-attacks\">nation-states</a> or nongovernmental organizations</li><li>News from local and national media, industry- and subject-specific publications, or other subject-matter experts</li><li>White papers, research reports, and other content produced by security organizations</li></ul><p>Producing strong strategic threat intelligence starts with asking focused, specific questions to set the intelligence requirements. It also takes analysts with expertise outside of typical cybersecurity skills  in particular, a strong understanding of sociopolitical and business concepts.</p><p>Although the final product is non-technical, producing effective strategic intelligence takes deep research through massive volumes of data, often across multiple languages. That can make the initial collection and processing of data too difficult to perform manually, even for those rarified analysts who possess the right language skills, technical background, and tradecraft. A threat intelligence solution that automates data collection and processing helps reduce this burden and allows analysts who do not have as much expertise to work more effectively.</p><h2 id=\"machine-learning-for-better-threat-intelligence\">Machine Learning for Better Threat Intelligence</h2><p>Data processing takes place at a scale today that requires automation to be comprehensive. Combine data points from many different types of sources  including open, dark web, and technical sources  to form the most robust picture possible.</p><p>Recorded Future uses <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/machine-learning-definition/\">machine learning</a> techniques in four ways to improve data collection and aggregation  to structure data into categories, to analyze text across multiple languages, to provide risk scores, and to generate predictive models.</p><h3 id=\"1-to-structure-data-into-entities-and-events\">1. To structure data into entities and events</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-graph\">Ontology</a> has to do with how we split concepts up and how we group them together. In data science, <strong>ontologies</strong> represent categories of <strong>entities</strong> based on their names, properties, and relationships to each other, making them easier to sort into hierarchies of sets. For example, Boston, London, and Gothenburg are all distinct entities that will also fall under the broader city entity.</p><p>If entities represent a way to sort physically distinct concepts, then <strong>events</strong> sort concepts over time. Recorded Future events are language independent  something like John visited Paris, John took a trip to Paris,    , and John a visit Paris are all recognized as the same event.</p><p>Ontologies and events enable powerful searches over categories, letting analysts focus on the bigger picture rather than having to manually sort through data themselves.</p><h3 id=\"2-to-structure-text-in-multiple-languages-through-natural-language-processing\">2. To structure text in multiple languages through natural language processing</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/cross-language-social-media-analysis\">With natural language processing</a>, entities and events are able to go beyond bare keywords, turning unstructured text from sources across different languages into a structured database.</p><p>The machine learning driving this process can separate advertising from primary content, classify text into categories like prose, data logs, or code, and disambiguate between entities with the same name (like Apple the company, and apple the fruit) by using contextual clues in the surrounding text.</p><p>This way, the system can parse text from millions of documents daily across seven different languages  a task that would require an impractically large and skilled team of human analysts to do. Saving time like this helps IT security teams work 32 percent more efficiently with Recorded Future.</p><h3 id=\"3-to-classify-events-and-entities-helping-human-analysts-prioritize-alerts\">3. To classify events and entities, helping human analysts prioritize alerts</h3><p>Machine learning and statistical methodology are used to further sort entities and events by importance  for example, by assigning risk scores to malicious entities.</p><p>Risk scores are calculated through two systems: one driven by rules based on human intuition and experience, and the other driven by machine learning trained on an already vetted dataset.</p><p>Classifiers like risk scores provide both a <strong>judgment</strong> (this event is critical) and <strong>context</strong> explaining the score (because multiple sources confirm that this IP address is malicious).</p><p>Automating how risks are classified saves analysts time sorting through false positives and deciding what to prioritize, helping IT security staff who use Recorded Future spend 34 percent less time <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-reporting\">compiling reports</a>.</p><h3 id=\"4-to-forecast-events-and-entity-properties-through-predictive-models\">4. To forecast events and entity properties through predictive models</h3><p>Machine learning can also generate models that predict the future, oftentimes much more accurately than any human analysts, by drawing on the deep pools of data previously mined and categorized.</p><p>This is a particularly strong law of large numbers application of machine learning  as we continue to draw on more sources of data, these <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/network-web\">predictive models</a> will become more and more accurate.</p><h2 id=\"threat-intelligence-use-cases\">Threat Intelligence Use Cases</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-use-cases\">diverse use cases</a> of threat intelligence make it an essential resource for cross-functional teams in any organization. Although its perhaps the most immediately valuable when it helps you prevent an attack, threat intelligence is also a useful part of triage, risk analysis, vulnerability management, and wide-scope decision making.</p><h2 id=\"incident-response\">Incident Response</h2><p>Security analysts in charge of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/incident-response-information\">incident response</a> report some of the highest levels of stress in the industry, and its no wonder why  the rate of cyber incidents has steadily climbed over the last two decades, and a high proportion of daily alerts turn out to false positives. When dealing with real incidents, analysts must often spend time painstakingly sorting through data manually to assess the problem.</p><p>Threat intelligence reduces the pressure in multiple ways:</p><ul><li>Automatically identifying and dismissing false positives</li><li>Enriching alerts with real-time context, like custom risk scores</li><li>Comparing information from internal and external sources</li></ul><p>Recorded Future users identify risks 10 times faster than they did before integrating threat intelligence into their security solutions, giving them days more time on average to respond to threats in an industry where even seconds can matter.</p><h2 id=\"security-operations\">Security Operations</h2><p>Most <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/empower-security-operations/\">security operations center</a> (SOC) teams must deal with huge volumes of alerts generated by the networks they monitor. Triaging these alerts takes too long, and many are never investigated at all. Alert fatigue leads analysts to take alerts less seriously than they should. Threat intelligence solves many of these problems  helping gather information about threats more quickly and accurately, filter out false alarms, speed up triage, and simplify incident analysis. With it, analysts can stop wasting time pursuing alerts based on:</p><ul><li>Actions that are more likely to be innocuous rather than malicious</li><li>Attacks that are not relevant to that enterprise</li><li>Attacks for which defenses and controls are already in place</li></ul><p>As well as <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/secops-intelligence\">accelerating triage</a>, threat intelligence can help SOC teams simplify incident analysis and containment. Recorded Future users resolve threats 63 percent faster, cutting the critical hours they spend on remediation by more than half.</p><h2 id=\"vulnerability-management\">Vulnerability Management</h2><p>Effective <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-management-prioritization/\">vulnerability management</a> means shifting from taking a patch everything, all the time approach  one that nobody can realistically ever achieve  to prioritizing vulnerabilities based on actual risk.</p><p>Although the number of vulnerabilities and threats has increased every year, research shows that most threats target the same, small proportion of vulnerabilities. Threat actors are also quicker  it now only takes fifteen days on average between a new vulnerability being announced and an exploit targeting it appearing.</p><p>This has two implications:</p><ul><li>You have two weeks to patch or remediate your systems against a new exploit. If you cant patch in that timeframe, have a plan to mitigate the damage.</li><li>If a new vulnerability is not exploited within two weeks to three months, its unlikely to ever be  patching it can take lower priority.</li></ul><p>Threat intelligence helps you identify the vulnerabilities that pose an actual risk to your organization, going beyond CVE scoring by combining internal vulnerability scanning data, external data, and additional context about the TTPs of threat actors. With Recorded Future, users identify 22 percent more real threats before they have a serious impact.</p><h2 id=\"risk-analysis\">Risk Analysis</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/smarter-risk-assessments/\">Risk modeling</a> can be a useful way for organizations to set investment priorities. But many risk models suffer from vague, non-quantified output that is hastily compiled, based on partial information, based on unfounded assumptions, or is difficult to take action on.</p><p>Threat intelligence provides context that helps risk models make defined risk measurements and be more transparent about their assumptions, variables, and outcomes. It can help answer questions such as:</p><ul><li>Which threat actors are using this attack, and do they target our industry?</li><li>How often has this specific attack been observed recently by enterprises like ours?</li><li>Is the trend up or down?</li><li>Which vulnerabilities does this attack exploit, and are those vulnerabilities present in our enterprise?</li><li>What kind of damage, technical and financial, has this attack caused in enterprises like ours?</li></ul><p>Asking the right questions with <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/threat-intelligence-platform\">Recorded Futures threat intelligence</a> is one of the ways users see an 86 percent reduction in unplanned downtime  a huge difference when even a minute of downtime can cost some organizations up to $9,000 in lost productivity and other damages.</p><h2 id=\"fraud-prevention\">Fraud Prevention</h2><p>To keep your organization safe, it isnt enough to only detect and respond to threats already exploiting your systems. You also need to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/fraud-prevention-threat-intelligence\">prevent fraudulent uses</a> of your data or brand.</p><p>Threat intelligence gathered from underground criminal communities provides a window into the motivations, methods, and tactics of threat actors, especially when this intelligence is correlated with information from the surface web, including technical feeds and indicators.</p><p>Use threat intelligence to prevent:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threats/payment-fraud\">Payment fraud</a></strong>  Monitoring sources like criminal communities, paste sites, and other forums for relevant payment card numbers, bank identifier numbers, or specific references to financial institutions can provide early warning of upcoming attacks that might affect your organization.</li><li><strong>Compromised data</strong>  Cybercriminals regularly upload massive caches of usernames and passwords to paste sites and the dark web, or make them available for sale on underground marketplaces. Monitor these sources with threat intelligence to watch out for leaked credentials, corporate data, or proprietary code.</li><li><strong>Typosquatting</strong>  Get <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/features/alerts/\">real-time alerts</a> on newly registered phishing and typosquatting domains to prevent cybercriminals from impersonating your brand and defrauding unsuspecting users.</li></ul><p>By avoiding more breaches with threat intelligence, Recorded Future users are able to save over $1 million per potential breach through damaging fines, penalties, and lost consumer trust.</p><h5 id=\"download-our-whitepaper-leveraging-the-dark-web-to-mitigate-payment-card-fraud\">Download our whitepaper, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/card-fraud-intelligence-white-paper\">Leveraging the Dark Web to Mitigate Payment Card Fraud</a></h5><h2 id=\"security-leadership\">Security Leadership</h2><p>CISOs and other <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-decision-making\">security leaders</a> must manage risk by balancing limited available resources against the need to secure their organizations from ever-evolving threats. Threat intelligence can help map the threat landscape, calculate risk, and give security personnel the intelligence and context to make better, faster decisions.</p><p>Today, security leaders must:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-decision-making\">Assess business and technical risks</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threats/emerging-threats\">emerging threats</a> and known unknowns that might impact the business</li><li>Identify the right strategies and technologies to mitigate the risks</li><li>Communicate the nature of the risks to top management, and justify investments in defensive measures</li></ul><p>Threat intelligence can be a critical resource for all these activities, providing information on general trends, such as:</p><ul><li>Which types of attacks are becoming more (or less) frequent</li><li>Which types of attacks are most costly to the victims</li><li>What new kinds of threat actors are coming forward, and the assets and enterprises they are targeting</li><li>The security practices and technologies that have proven the most (or least) successful in stopping or mitigating these attacks</li></ul><p>It can also enable security groups to assess whether an emerging threat is likely to affect their specific enterprise based on factors such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Industry</strong>  Is the threat affecting other businesses in our vertical?</li><li><strong>Technology</strong>  Does the threat involve compromising software, hardware, or other technologies used in our enterprise?</li><li><strong>Geography</strong>  Does the threat <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/geopolitical-intelligence-identifies-risk-globally\">target facilities in regions where we have operations</a>?</li><li><strong>Attack method</strong>  Have methods used in the attack, including social engineering and technical methods, been used successfully against our company or similar ones?</li></ul><p>With these types of intelligence, gathered from a broad set of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/relevant-threat-intelligence-sources\">external data sources</a>, security decision makers gain a holistic view of the cyber risk landscape and the greatest risks to their enterprise.</p><p>Here are four key areas where threat intelligence helps security leaders make decisions:</p><ul><li><strong>Mitigation</strong>  Threat intelligence helps security leaders prioritize the vulnerabilities and weaknesses that threat actors are most likely to target, giving context on the TTPs those threat actors use, and therefore the weaknesses they tend to exploit.</li><li><strong>Communication</strong>  CISOs are often challenged by the need to describe threats and justify countermeasures in terms that will motivate non-technical business leaders, such as cost, impact on customers, new technologies. Threat intelligence provides powerful ammunition for these discussions, such as the impact of similar attacks on companies of the same size in other industries or trends and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threats/dark-web-monitoring\">intelligence from the dark web</a> indicating that the enterprise is likely to be targeted.</li><li><strong>Supporting leaders</strong>  Threat intelligence can provide security leaders with a real-time picture of the latest threats, trends, and events, helping security leaders respond to a threat or communicate the potential impact of a new threat type to business leaders and board members in a timely and efficient manner.</li><li><strong>The security skills gap</strong>  CISOs must make sure the IT organization has the human resources to carry out its mission. But cybersecuritys skills shortage means existing security staff frequently cope with unmanageable workloads. Threat intelligence automates some of the most labor-intensive tasks, rapidly collecting data and correlating context from multiple intelligence sources, prioritizing risks, and reducing unnecessary alerts. Powerful threat intelligence also helps junior personnel quickly upskill and perform above their experience level.</li></ul><h2 id=\"reducing-third-party-risk\">Reducing Third-Party Risk</h2><p>Countless organizations are transforming the way they do business through digital processes. Theyre moving data from internal networks to the cloud, and gathering more information than ever before.</p><p>Making data easier to collect, store, and analyze is certainly changing many industries for the better, but this free flow of information comes with a price. It means that to assess the risk of our own organization, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/third-party-intelligence\">we also have to consider the security of our partners, vendors, and other third parties</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the most common third-party risk management practices employed today are lagging behind security requirements. Static assessments of risk, like financial audits and security certificate verifications, are still important, but they often lack context and arent always timely. Theres a need for a solution that offers real-time context on the actual threat landscape.</p><p>Threat intelligence is one way to do just that. It can provide transparency into the threat environments of the third parties you work with, providing real-time alerts on threats and changes to their risks and giving you the context you need to evaluate your relationships.</p>"}], "summary": "<h2 id=\"what-is-threat-intelligence-in-cybersecurity\">What Is Threat Intelligence in Cybersecurity?</h2><p>Digital technologies lie at the heart of nearly every industry today. The automation and greater connectedness they afford have revolutionized the worlds economic and cultural institutions  but theyve also brought risk in the form of cyberattacks. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-journey\">Threat intelligence</a>, often synonymous with <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/open-source-intelligence-definition\">open source intelligence (OSINT)</a> is knowledge that allows you to prevent or mitigate those attacks. Rooted in data, threat intelligence provides context  like who is attacking you, what their motivation and capabilities are, and what indicators of compromise in your systems to look for  that helps you make informed decisions about your security.</p><blockquote><p><em>Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and action-oriented advice about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets.

Additionally, the attack surfaces organizations have to understand and protect are bigger now than ever before. Threats arent coming from one angle, organizations need to understand business risk from cyber attacks, physical security and operational disruptions, attacks on their reputation, and more.</p><p>Some organizations try to incorporate <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-feeds/\">threat data feeds</a> into their network, but dont know what to do with all that extra data, adding to the burden of analysts who may not have the tools to decide what to prioritize and what to ignore.</p><p>A threat intelligence solution can address each of these issues. The best solutions use a combination of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-graph-retrospective\">machine learning</a> to automate data collection and processing, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/integrations\">integrate with your existing solutions</a>, take in unstructured data from disparate sources, and then connect the dots by providing context on indicators of compromise (IoCs) and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors.</p><p>Threat intelligence is actionable  its timely, provides context, and is able to be understood by the people in charge of making decisions.</p><h2 id=\"who-can-benefit-from-threat-intelligence\">Who Can Benefit From Threat Intelligence?</h2><p>All security &amp; risk teams and leaders! Threat intelligence is widely imagined to be the domain of elite analysts. In reality, it adds value across <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/cyber-threat-intelligence-team\">security functions for organizations of all sizes.</a></p><p>When threat intelligence is treated as a separate function within a broader security team rather than an essential component that augments every other function, the result is that many of the people who would <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-business-benefits\">benefit the most from threat intelligence</a> dont have access to it when they need it.</p><p>Security operations teams are routinely unable to process the alerts they receive  threat intelligence integrates with the security solutions you already use, helping automatically prioritize and filter alerts and other threats. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-management-prioritization\">Vulnerability management</a> teams can more accurately prioritize the most important vulnerabilities with access to the external insights and context provided by threat intelligence. And fraud prevention, risk analysis, and other high-level security processes are enriched by the understanding of the current threat landscape that threat intelligence provides, including key insights on threat actors, their tactics, techniques, and procedures, and more from data sources across the web.</p><p>Look at our section on use cases below for a deeper look at how every security role can benefit from threat intelligence.<br /><br /></p><h2 id=\"the-cyber-threat-intelligence-cycle\">The Cyber Threat Intelligence Cycle</h2><p>So, how does threat intelligence get produced? Raw data is not the same thing as intelligence  threat intelligence is the finished product that comes out of a six-part cycle of data collection, processing, and analysis. This process is a cycle because new questions and gaps in knowledge are identified during the course of developing intelligence, leading to new collection requirements being set. An effective intelligence program is iterative, becoming more refined over time.</p><p>To maximize the value of the threat intelligence you produce, its critical that you identify your <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-use-cases/\">use cases</a> and define your objectives before doing anything else.</p><h3 id=\"1-planning-and-direction\">1. Planning and Direction</h3><p>The first step to producing actionable threat intelligence is to ask the right question.</p><p>The questions that best drive the creation of actionable threat intelligence focus on a single fact, event, or activity  broad, open-ended questions should usually be avoided.</p><p>Prioritize your intelligence objectives based on factors like how closely they adhere to your organizations core values, how big of an impact the resulting decision will have, and how time sensitive the decision is.</p><p>One important guiding factor at this stage is understanding who will consume and benefit from the finished product  will the intelligence go to a team of analysts with technical expertise who need a quick report on a new exploit, or to an executive thats looking for a broad overview of trends to inform their security investment decisions for the next quarter?</p><h3 id=\"2-collection\">2. Collection</h3><p>The next step is to gather raw data that fulfills the requirements set in the first stage. Its best to collect data from a wide range of sources  internal ones like network event logs and records of past incident responses, and external ones from the open web, the dark web, and technical sources.</p><p>Threat data is usually thought of as lists of IoCs, such as malicious IP addresses, domains, and file hashes, but it can also include vulnerability information, such as the personally identifiable information of customers, raw code from paste sites, and text from news sources or social media.</p><h3 id=\"3-processing\">3. Processing</h3><p>Once all the raw data has been collected, you need to sort it, organizing it with metadata tags and filtering out redundant information or false positives and negatives.</p><p>Today, even small organizations collect data on the order of millions of log events and hundreds of thousands of indicators every day. Its too much for human analysts to process efficiently  <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-graph\">data collection and processing has to be automated</a> to begin making any sense of it.</p><p>Solutions like SIEMs are a good place to start because they make it relatively easy to structure data with correlation rules that can be set up for a few different use cases, but they can only take in a limited number of data types.</p><p>If youre collecting unstructured data from many different internal and external sources, youll need a more robust solution. Recorded Future uses machine learning and natural language processing to parse text from millions of unstructured documents across seven different languages and classify them using language-independent ontologies and events, enabling analysts to perform powerful and intuitive searches that go beyond bare keywords and simple correlation rules.</p><h3 id=\"4-analysis\">4. Analysis</h3><p>The next step is to make sense of the processed data. The goal of analysis is to search for potential security issues and notify the relevant teams in a format that fulfills the intelligence requirements outlined in the planning and direction stage.</p><p>Threat intelligence can take many forms depending on the initial objectives and the intended audience, but the idea is to get the data into a format that the audience will understand. This can range from simple threat lists to peer-reviewed reports.</p><h3 id=\"5-dissemination\">5. Dissemination</h3><p>The finished product is then distributed to its intended consumers. For threat intelligence to be actionable, it has to get to the right people at the right time.</p><p>It also needs to be tracked so that there is continuity between one <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-lifecycle-phases/\">intelligence cycle</a> and the next and the learning is not lost. Use ticketing systems that integrate with your other security systems to track each step of the intelligence cycle  each time a new intelligence request comes up, tickets can be submitted, written up, reviewed, and fulfilled by multiple people across different teams, all in one place.</p><h3 id=\"6-feedback\">6. Feedback</h3><p>The final step is when the intelligence cycle comes full circle, making it closely related to the initial planning and direction phase. After receiving the finished intelligence product, whoever made the initial request reviews it and determines whether their questions were answered. This drives the objectives and procedures of the next intelligence cycle, again making documentation and continuity essential.</p><h2 id=\"the-types-of-threat-intelligence\">The Types of Threat Intelligence</h2><p>As demonstrated by the intelligence lifecycle, the final product will look different depending on the initial intelligence requirements, sources of information, and intended audience. It can be helpful to break down threat intelligence into a few categories based on these criteria.</p><p>Threat intelligence is often broken down into three subcategories:</p><ul><li><strong>Strategic</strong>  Broader trends typically meant for a non-technical audience</li><li><strong>Tactical</strong>  Outlines of the tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors for a more technical audience</li><li><strong>Operational</strong>  Technical details about specific attacks and campaigns (sometimes also called <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/technical-threat-intelligence/\">technical threat intelligence</a>)</li></ul><h5 id=\"as-more-types-of-threats-converge-security-professions-need-to-adapt-their-playbook-learn-more-in-our-upcoming-webinar-the-convergence-of-threats-how-to-stay-ahead-of-cyber-and-physical-adversaries\">As more types of threats converge, security professions need to adapt their playbook. Learn more in our upcoming webinar <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/threat-convergence-webinar\">The Convergence of Threats: How to Stay Ahead of Cyber and Physical Adversaries</a></h5><h2 id=\"tactical-threat-intelligence\">Tactical Threat Intelligence</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/tactical-threat-intelligence/\">Tactical threat intelligence</a> outlines the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors. It should help defenders understand, in specific terms, how their organization might be attacked and the best ways to defend against or mitigate those attacks. It usually includes technical context, and is used by personnel directly involved in the defense of an organization, such as system architects, administrators, and security staff.</p><p>Stakeholders and consumers of tactical threat intelligence can include:</p><ul><li>SOC Analysts</li><li>IT Analysts</li><li>Vulnerability Management Teams</li><li>Security Architects (for integrations)</li></ul><p>Reports produced by security vendors are often the easiest way to get tactical threat intelligence. Look for information in reports about the attack vectors, tools, and infrastructure that attackers are using, including specifics about what vulnerabilities are being targeted and what exploits attackers are leveraging, as well as what strategies and tools that they may be using to avoid or delay detection.</p><p>Tactical threat intelligence should be used to inform improvements to existing security controls and processes and speed up incident response. Because many of the questions answered by tactical intelligence are unique to your organization, and need to be answered on a short deadline  for example, Is this critical vulnerability being exploited by threat actors targeting my industry present in my systems?  having a threat intelligence solution that integrates data from within your own network is crucial.</p><h2 id=\"operational-threat-intelligence\">Operational Threat Intelligence</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/operational-threat-intelligence\">Operational intelligence</a> is knowledge about cyber attacks, events, or campaigns. It gives specialized insights that help incident response teams understand the nature, intent, and timing of specific attacks.</p><p>Stakeholders and consumers of operational threat intelligence can include:</p><ul><li>Security Leaders</li><li>SOC Managers</li><li>Threat Hunters </li><li>Cyber Threat Intelligence Teams</li><li>Incident Responders</li></ul><p>Because this usually includes technical information  information like what attack vector is being used, what vulnerabilities are being exploited, or what command and control domains are being employed  this kind of intelligence is also referred to as <strong>technical threat intelligence</strong>. A common source of technical information is threat data feeds, which usually focus on a single type of indicator, like malware hashes or suspicious domains.</p><p>But if technical threat intelligence is strictly thought of as deriving from technical information like threat data feeds, then technical and operational threat intelligence are not totally synonymous  more like a Venn diagram with huge overlaps. Other sources of information on specific attacks can come from closed sources like the interception of threat group communications, either through infiltration or breaking into those channels of communication.</p><p>Consequently, there are a few barriers to gathering this kind of intelligence:</p><ul><li><strong>Access</strong>  Threat groups may communicate over private and encrypted channels, or require some proof of identification. There are also language barriers with threat groups located in foreign countries.</li><li><strong>Noise</strong>  It can be difficult or impossible to manually gather good intelligence from high-volume sources like chat rooms and social media.</li><li><strong>Obfuscation</strong>  To avoid detection, threat groups might employ obfuscation tactics like using codenames.</li></ul><p>Threat intelligence solutions that rely on <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/machine-learning-cybersecurity-applications/\">machine learning processes for automated data collection</a> on a large scale can overcome many of these issues when trying to develop effective operational threat intelligence. A solution that uses natural language processing, for example, will be able to gather information from foreign-language sources without needing human expertise to decipher it.</p><h2 id=\"strategic-threat-intelligence\">Strategic Threat Intelligence</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/strategic-threat-intelligence/\">Strategic threat intelligence</a> provides a broad overview of an organizations threat landscape.

Combine data points from many different types of sources  including open, dark web, and technical sources  to form the most robust picture possible.</p><p>Recorded Future uses <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/machine-learning-definition/\">machine learning</a> techniques in four ways to improve data collection and aggregation  to structure data into categories, to analyze text across multiple languages, to provide risk scores, and to generate predictive models.</p><h3 id=\"1-to-structure-data-into-entities-and-events\">1. To structure data into entities and events</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-graph\">Ontology</a> has to do with how we split concepts up and how we group them together. In data science, <strong>ontologies</strong> represent categories of <strong>entities</strong> based on their names, properties, and relationships to each other, making them easier to sort into hierarchies of sets. For example, Boston, London, and Gothenburg are all distinct entities that will also fall under the broader city entity.</p><p>If entities represent a way to sort physically distinct concepts, then <strong>events</strong> sort concepts over time. Recorded Future events are language independent  something like John visited Paris, John took a trip to Paris,    , and John a visit Paris are all recognized as the same event.</p><p>Ontologies and events enable powerful searches over categories, letting analysts focus on the bigger picture rather than having to manually sort through data themselves.</p><h3 id=\"2-to-structure-text-in-multiple-languages-through-natural-language-processing\">2. To structure text in multiple languages through natural language processing</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/cross-language-social-media-analysis\">With natural language processing</a>, entities and events are able to go beyond bare keywords, turning unstructured text from sources across different languages into a structured database.</p><p>The machine learning driving this process can separate advertising from primary content, classify text into categories like prose, data logs, or code, and disambiguate between entities with the same name (like Apple the company, and apple the fruit) by using contextual clues in the surrounding text.</p><p>This way, the system can parse text from millions of documents daily across seven different languages  a task that would require an impractically large and skilled team of human analysts to do. Saving time like this helps IT security teams work 32 percent more efficiently with Recorded Future.</p><h3 id=\"3-to-classify-events-and-entities-helping-human-analysts-prioritize-alerts\">3. To classify events and entities, helping human analysts prioritize alerts</h3><p>Machine learning and statistical methodology are used to further sort entities and events by importance  for example, by assigning risk scores to malicious entities.</p><p>Risk scores are calculated through two systems: one driven by rules based on human intuition and experience, and the other driven by machine learning trained on an already vetted dataset.</p><p>Classifiers like risk scores provide both a <strong>judgment</strong> (this event is critical) and <strong>context</strong> explaining the score (because multiple sources confirm that this IP address is malicious).</p><p>Automating how risks are classified saves analysts time sorting through false positives and deciding what to prioritize, helping IT security staff who use Recorded Future spend 34 percent less time <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-reporting\">compiling reports</a>.</p><h3 id=\"4-to-forecast-events-and-entity-properties-through-predictive-models\">4. To forecast events and entity properties through predictive models</h3><p>Machine learning can also generate models that predict the future, oftentimes much more accurately than any human analysts, by drawing on the deep pools of data previously mined and categorized.</p><p>This is a particularly strong law of large numbers application of machine learning  as we continue to draw on more sources of data, these <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/network-web\">predictive models</a> will become more and more accurate.</p><h2 id=\"threat-intelligence-use-cases\">Threat Intelligence Use Cases</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-use-cases\">diverse use cases</a> of threat intelligence make it an essential resource for cross-functional teams in any organization. Although its perhaps the most immediately valuable when it helps you prevent an attack, threat intelligence is also a useful part of triage, risk analysis, vulnerability management, and wide-scope decision making.</p><h2 id=\"incident-response\">Incident Response</h2><p>Security analysts in charge of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/incident-response-information\">incident response</a> report some of the highest levels of stress in the industry, and its no wonder why  the rate of cyber incidents has steadily climbed over the last two decades, and a high proportion of daily alerts turn out to false positives. When dealing with real incidents, analysts must often spend time painstakingly sorting through data manually to assess the problem.</p><p>Threat intelligence reduces the pressure in multiple ways:</p><ul><li>Automatically identifying and dismissing false positives</li><li>Enriching alerts with real-time context, like custom risk scores</li><li>Comparing information from internal and external sources</li></ul><p>Recorded Future users identify risks 10 times faster than they did before integrating threat intelligence into their security solutions, giving them days more time on average to respond to threats in an industry where even seconds can matter.</p><h2 id=\"security-operations\">Security Operations</h2><p>Most <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/empower-security-operations/\">security operations center</a> (SOC) teams must deal with huge volumes of alerts generated by the networks they monitor. Triaging these alerts takes too long, and many are never investigated at all. Alert fatigue leads analysts to take alerts less seriously than they should. Threat intelligence solves many of these problems  helping gather information about threats more quickly and accurately, filter out false alarms, speed up triage, and simplify incident analysis. With it, analysts can stop wasting time pursuing alerts based on:</p><ul><li>Actions that are more likely to be innocuous rather than malicious</li><li>Attacks that are not relevant to that enterprise</li><li>Attacks for which defenses and controls are already in place</li></ul><p>As well as <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/secops-intelligence\">accelerating triage</a>, threat intelligence can help SOC teams simplify incident analysis and containment. Recorded Future users resolve threats 63 percent faster, cutting the critical hours they spend on remediation by more than half.</p><h2 id=\"vulnerability-management\">Vulnerability Management</h2><p>Effective <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-management-prioritization/\">vulnerability management</a> means shifting from taking a patch everything, all the time approach  one that nobody can realistically ever achieve  to prioritizing vulnerabilities based on actual risk.</p><p>Although the number of vulnerabilities and threats has increased every year, research shows that most threats target the same, small proportion of vulnerabilities. Threat actors are also quicker  it now only takes fifteen days on average between a new vulnerability being announced and an exploit targeting it appearing.</p><p>This has two implications:</p><ul><li>You have two weeks to patch or remediate your systems against a new exploit. If you cant patch in that timeframe, have a plan to mitigate the damage.</li><li>If a new vulnerability is not exploited within two weeks to three months, its unlikely to ever be  patching it can take lower priority.</li></ul><p>Threat intelligence helps you identify the vulnerabilities that pose an actual risk to your organization, going beyond CVE scoring by combining internal vulnerability scanning data, external data, and additional context about the TTPs of threat actors. With Recorded Future, users identify 22 percent more real threats before they have a serious impact.</p><h2 id=\"risk-analysis\">Risk Analysis</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/smarter-risk-assessments/\">Risk modeling</a> can be a useful way for organizations to set investment priorities. But many risk models suffer from vague, non-quantified output that is hastily compiled, based on partial information, based on unfounded assumptions, or is difficult to take action on.</p><p>Threat intelligence provides context that helps risk models make defined risk measurements and be more transparent about their assumptions, variables, and outcomes. It can help answer questions such as:</p><ul><li>Which threat actors are using this attack, and do they target our industry?</li><li>How often has this specific attack been observed recently by enterprises like ours?</li><li>Is the trend up or down?</li><li>Which vulnerabilities does this attack exploit, and are those vulnerabilities present in our enterprise?</li><li>What kind of damage, technical and financial, has this attack caused in enterprises like ours?</li></ul><p>Asking the right questions with <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/threat-intelligence-platform\">Recorded Futures threat intelligence</a> is one of the ways users see an 86 percent reduction in unplanned downtime  a huge difference when even a minute of downtime can cost some organizations up to $9,000 in lost productivity and other damages.</p><h2 id=\"fraud-prevention\">Fraud Prevention</h2><p>To keep your organization safe, it isnt enough to only detect and respond to threats already exploiting your systems. You also need to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/fraud-prevention-threat-intelligence\">prevent fraudulent uses</a> of your data or brand.</p><p>Threat intelligence gathered from underground criminal communities provides a window into the motivations, methods, and tactics of threat actors, especially when this intelligence is correlated with information from the surface web, including technical feeds and indicators.</p><p>Use threat intelligence to prevent:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threats/payment-fraud\">Payment fraud</a></strong>  Monitoring sources like criminal communities, paste sites, and other forums for relevant payment card numbers, bank identifier numbers, or specific references to financial institutions can provide early warning of upcoming attacks that might affect your organization.</li><li><strong>Compromised data</strong>  Cybercriminals regularly upload massive caches of usernames and passwords to paste sites and the dark web, or make them available for sale on underground marketplaces. Monitor these sources with threat intelligence to watch out for leaked credentials, corporate data, or proprietary code.</li><li><strong>Typosquatting</strong>  Get <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/features/alerts/\">real-time alerts</a> on newly registered phishing and typosquatting domains to prevent cybercriminals from impersonating your brand and defrauding unsuspecting users.</li></ul><p>By avoiding more breaches with threat intelligence, Recorded Future users are able to save over $1 million per potential breach through damaging fines, penalties, and lost consumer trust.</p><h5 id=\"download-our-whitepaper-leveraging-the-dark-web-to-mitigate-payment-card-fraud\">Download our whitepaper, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/card-fraud-intelligence-white-paper\">Leveraging the Dark Web to Mitigate Payment Card Fraud</a></h5><h2 id=\"security-leadership\">Security Leadership</h2><p>CISOs and other <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-decision-making\">security leaders</a> must manage risk by balancing limited available resources against the need to secure their organizations from ever-evolving threats. Threat intelligence can help map the threat landscape, calculate risk, and give security personnel the intelligence and context to make better, faster decisions.</p><p>Today, security leaders must:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-decision-making\">Assess business and technical risks</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threats/emerging-threats\">emerging threats</a> and known unknowns that might impact the business</li><li>Identify the right strategies and technologies to mitigate the risks</li><li>Communicate the nature of the risks to top management, and justify investments in defensive measures</li></ul><p>Threat intelligence can be a critical resource for all these activities, providing information on general trends, such as:</p><ul><li>Which types of attacks are becoming more (or less) frequent</li><li>Which types of attacks are most costly to the victims</li><li>What new kinds of threat actors are coming forward, and the assets and enterprises they are targeting</li><li>The security practices and technologies that have proven the most (or least) successful in stopping or mitigating these attacks</li></ul><p>It can also enable security groups to assess whether an emerging threat is likely to affect their specific enterprise based on factors such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Industry</strong>  Is the threat affecting other businesses in our vertical?</li><li><strong>Technology</strong>  Does the threat involve compromising software, hardware, or other technologies used in our enterprise?</li><li><strong>Geography</strong>  Does the threat <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/geopolitical-intelligence-identifies-risk-globally\">target facilities in regions where we have operations</a>?</li><li><strong>Attack method</strong>  Have methods used in the attack, including social engineering and technical methods, been used successfully against our company or similar ones?</li></ul><p>With these types of intelligence, gathered from a broad set of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/relevant-threat-intelligence-sources\">external data sources</a>, security decision makers gain a holistic view of the cyber risk landscape and the greatest risks to their enterprise.</p><p>Here are four key areas where threat intelligence helps security leaders make decisions:</p><ul><li><strong>Mitigation</strong>  Threat intelligence helps security leaders prioritize the vulnerabilities and weaknesses that threat actors are most likely to target, giving context on the TTPs those threat actors use, and therefore the weaknesses they tend to exploit.</li><li><strong>Communication</strong>  CISOs are often challenged by the need to describe threats and justify countermeasures in terms that will motivate non-technical business leaders, such as cost, impact on customers, new technologies. Threat intelligence provides powerful ammunition for these discussions, such as the impact of similar attacks on companies of the same size in other industries or trends and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threats/dark-web-monitoring\">intelligence from the dark web</a> indicating that the enterprise is likely to be targeted.</li><li><strong>Supporting leaders</strong>  Threat intelligence can provide security leaders with a real-time picture of the latest threats, trends, and events, helping security leaders respond to a threat or communicate the potential impact of a new threat type to business leaders and board members in a timely and efficient manner.</li><li><strong>The security skills gap</strong>  CISOs must make sure the IT organization has the human resources to carry out its mission. But cybersecuritys skills shortage means existing security staff frequently cope with unmanageable workloads. Threat intelligence automates some of the most labor-intensive tasks, rapidly collecting data and correlating context from multiple intelligence sources, prioritizing risks, and reducing unnecessary alerts. Powerful threat intelligence also helps junior personnel quickly upskill and perform above their experience level.</li></ul><h2 id=\"reducing-third-party-risk\">Reducing Third-Party Risk</h2><p>Countless organizations are transforming the way they do business through digital processes. Theyre moving data from internal networks to the cloud, and gathering more information than ever before.</p><p>Making data easier to collect, store, and analyze is certainly changing many industries for the better, but this free flow of information comes with a price. It means that to assess the risk of our own organization, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/third-party-intelligence\">we also have to consider the security of our partners, vendors, and other third parties</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the most common third-party risk management practices employed today are lagging behind security requirements. Static assessments of risk, like financial audits and security certificate verifications, are still important, but they often lack context and arent always timely. Theres a need for a solution that offers real-time context on the actual threat landscape.</p><p>Threat intelligence is one way to do just that. It can provide transparency into the threat environments of the third parties you work with, providing real-time alerts on threats and changes to their risks and giving you the context you need to evaluate your relationships.</p>", "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "What Is Threat Intelligence?

This intelligence can be used to inform decisions regarding the subjects response to that menace or hazard.</p></div><p>And heres a definition provided by Maggie McDaniel, a Vice President of Insikt Group at Recorded Future, Allan Liska, our senior solutions architect, and Levi Gundert, our Chief Strategy Officer:</p><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\"></div><p>The best threat intelligence solutions use <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/machine-learning-threat-intelligence/\">machine learning</a> to automate data collection and processing, integrate with your existing solutions, take in unstructured data from disparate sources, and then connect the dots by providing context on indicators of compromise (IOCs) and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors.</p><p>Threat intelligence is often broken down into three subcategories:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/strategic-threat-intelligence/\">Strategic</a>: Broader trends typically meant for a non-technical audience</li><li><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/tactical-threat-intelligence/\">Tactical</a>: Outlines of the tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors for a more technical audience</li><li><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/operational-threat-intelligence/\">Operational</a>: <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/technical-threat-intelligence/\">Technical</a> details about specific attacks and campaigns</li></ul><p>To hear Liska and Gundert go into greater depth, check out our podcast episode defining threat intelligence: </p><h3 id=\"why-is-threat-intelligence-important\">Why Is Threat Intelligence Important?</h3><p>At Recorded Future, all of our work is motivated by three core beliefs:</p><ul><li>Threat intelligence is only useful when it gives you the context you need to make informed decisions and take action.</li><li>Threat intelligence is for everyone.</li><li>People and machines work better together.</li></ul><p>Well talk about each one in turn here.</p><p><strong>1. Threat intelligence is only useful when it gives you the context you need to make informed decisions and take action.</strong></p><p>Today, the cybersecurity industry faces numerous challenges  increasingly persistent and devious threat actors, floods of irrelevant data and false alarms across multiple, unconnected security solutions, and a major skills gap.</p><p>Some organizations try to incorporate <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-feeds/\">threat data feeds</a> into their network, but dont know what to do with all of that extra data, adding to the burden of analysts who may not have the tools to decide what to prioritize and what to ignore.</p><p>Threat intelligence needs to be actionable  it needs to be timely and arrive in a format that can be understood by whoevers consuming it. One way that threat intelligence becomes more actionable is when it easily integrates with all the security solutions already present in your environment. Recorded Futures <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/browser-extension-overview/\">browser extension</a>, for example, layers on top of all web-based security solutions to provide instant access to information like risk scores, CVEs, hashes, domains, and IP addresses, right on the webpage.</p><p><strong>2. Threat intelligence is for everyone.</strong></p><p>No matter what security role you work in, threat intelligence can augment your work. Its not a separate domain of security only meant for elite analysts  its the context that adds value to all security functions, across organizations of all sizes. Security operations, incident response, vulnerability management, fraud prevention, risk management, and high-level security planning and decision-making all benefit from the context that threat intelligence provides.</p><p>To get those benefits without adding to your workload, however, threat intelligence needs to integrate with the solutions and workflows you already rely on and have low barriers to entry. When its treated as a separate function within a broader security paradigm rather than an essential component that augments every other function, the result is that many of the people who would benefit the most from threat intelligence dont have access to it when they need it.</p><p>Security operations teams can rarely keep up with all of the alerts they receive  threat intelligence helps automatically prioritize and filter alerts and other threats. Vulnerability management teams can hone in on the most important vulnerabilities by using threat intelligence to determine what vulnerabilities represent the biggest risks based on the external threat landscape. And fraud prevention, risk analysis, and other high-level security processes are enriched by <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-actor-types/\">key insights on threat actors</a> and their tactics, techniques, and procedures.</p><p><strong>3. People and machines work better together.</strong></p><p>Machines can process and categorize raw data at speeds orders of magnitude quicker than humans. Conversely, humans can perform intuitive, big-picture analysis far more effectively than any artificial intelligence  but only if theyre not bogged down with tedious research and the processing of huge volumes of data. When the two are paired together, each one works smarter, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-time-money/\">saving time and money</a>, reducing burnout, and improving security overall.</p><h3 id=\"learn-more\">Learn More</h3><p>This is only a cursory look at the topic of threat intelligence  if you want to dive deeper into any of the topics mentioned above, check out our book, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/book\" rel=\"noopener\">The Intelligence Handbook</a>.

The activity was identified through a combination of Network Intelligence and analysis derived from open-source reporting. The report will be of most interest to network defenders and individuals engaged in strategic and operational intelligence relating to the activities of the Russian state in cyberspace.</p><h4 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h4><p>Beginning in July 2022, Recorded Futures Insikt Group observed the recurring use of similar infrastructure by the threat activity group TAG-53. This newly discovered infrastructure likely overlaps with other infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) previously attributed to Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM, who have been linked to activity aligning with Russian state interests.</p><p>Insikt Group has observed the recurring use of common traits by TAG-53 when curating its infrastructure, including the use of domain names employing a specific pattern construct along with Lets Encrypt TLS certificates, the use of a specific cluster of hosting providers, and the use of a small cluster of autonomous systems.</p><p>TAG-53 infrastructure was found to contain a spoofed Microsoft login page masquerading as a legitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the United States, suggesting that some TAG-53 infrastructure has likely already been operationalized. Based on historical public reporting on overlapping TAG-53 campaigns, it is likely that this credential harvesting activity is enabled in part through phishing.</p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure used by TAG-53, a group likely linked to suspected Russian threat activity groups Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM.</li><li>The identified TAG-53 infrastructure features common traits including the use of specific domain registrars, the use of Lets Encrypt TLS certificates, and a small cluster of autonomous systems. Most of TAG-53s domains use a specific stylistic structure.</li><li>TAG-53 has used domains masquerading as organizations across multiple industry verticals, with a particular focus on government, intelligence, and military industries.</li></ul><h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4><p>TAG-53 is consistent when setting up its infrastructure, which bears significant hallmarks and crossover with infrastructure attributed to Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM. The group continues to use particular stylistic structures when registering malicious domains alongside the use of specific domain registrars with IP addresses that reside in a small cluster of autonomous systems.</p><p>On August 15, 2022, a Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations\">report</a> published in collaboration with Googles Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Proofpoints Threat Research Team detailed SEABORGIUMs phishing operations. In this research, Microsoft assesses that SEABORGIUM originates from Russia and has objectives and victimology that align closely with Russian state interests. Microsoft denotes that SEABORGIUM shares overlaps with Callisto Group, TA446, and COLDRIVER and indicates that the threat actor has carried out persistent phishing and credential theft campaigns that have led to intrusions and data theft. SEABORGIUM primarily focuses its targeting on NATO countries, including a specific emphasis on the United States and the United Kingdom. The group also targeted Ukraine in the run-up to Russias full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.</p><p>Googles TAG <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe\">reported</a> in March and <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe\">updated</a> in May 2022 that COLDRIVER has conducted credential phishing campaigns using Gmail accounts targeting nongovernmental organizations and think tanks, journalists, and government and defense officials. TAG also suggests that COLDRIVERs TTPs have evolved over time, moving towards incorporating PDF or DOC file links that are hosted on Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive within its phishing emails.</p><h4 id=\"threat-and-technical-analysis\">Threat and Technical Analysis</h4><p>Insikt Group used intelligence provided in open-source reporting (<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/calisto-continues-its-credential-harvesting-campaign\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe\">4</a>) to profile TAG-53 infrastructure that likely overlaps with Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM infrastructure. TAG-53 infrastructure was uncovered by analyzing specific combinations of domain registrars, autonomous systems, domain name structures, and related TLS certificates. Based on this information, it is highly likely that this threat group is continuing its phishing and credential-harvesting operations.

Just because nothing much seems to be happening <em>right now</em>, doesnt mean you should sit back and wait.</p><p>Internal hunting is the process of aggressively tracking and eliminating threats. This includes things like device and network mapping, distinguishing between good and bad behavior, searching for anomalies, and setting up/monitoring honeypots.</p><p>This type of proactive security work has a whole host of benefits, including:</p><ul><li>Enhanced contextual threat intelligence.</li><li>Better visibility of potential weaknesses.</li><li>Early and accurate threat detection.</li><li>Opportunity to control and minimize damage from unexpected threats.</li><li>Improved defenses against identified threats.</li><li>The ability to avoid fines and bad publicity.</li></ul><p>And on the face of it, these proactive activities seem like sensible security measures, which of course they are.</p><p>But theres more to it than that.</p><p>During times of peace, armies dont simply conduct exercises with the aim of maintaining skills in shooting, building clearance, and so on. They do it because it stops the troops from becoming soft and lazy.</p><p>When a war breaks out, you dont just need soldiers with well-practiced skills, you need them to be mentally ready.</p><p>The same is true of your information security teams.</p><p>By engaging in internal hunting, your security teams will constantly hone and develop their skills. This is exactly what threat actors are doing, so why let your defenses fall behind?</p><p>Theyll also learn to work effectively as a team. People inevitably have strengths and weaknesses, which can be brought to the fore through enhanced teamwork and information sharing.</p><p>Last, and perhaps most difficult to quantify, is the tangible evidence of return on investment (ROI) to the organization. Executive teams are increasingly becoming aware of how damaging a successful breach can be, but very few security or threat intelligence activities can be reliably be measured in terms of ROI.</p><p>On the other hand, the success of an internal hunting operation is eminently measurable, and bound to be well received.</p><p><strong>Action</strong>: Aggressively track and eliminate threats through internal hunting.<br /><strong>Result</strong>: Tried and tested security teams.</p><h3 id=\"realize-nobody-sees-everything--and-act-accordingly\">Realize Nobody Sees Everything  And Act Accordingly</h3><p>When you start to take threat intelligence seriously, theres one fact that should always be kept firmly in mind.</p><p>Nobody sees everything. <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/29/technology/judge-apple-feds/\" rel=\"noopener\">Not even the NSA</a>.</p><p>And knowing this, youll be able to approach vendors with realistic expectations. Their solutions can provide <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/strategic-threat-intelligence/\">strategic threat intelligence</a>, but they probably arent going to provide information about specific events <em>within your network</em>.</p><p>And this is not to say that you should avoid open source intelligence (OSINT) platforms. They provide a great deal of value, and will enable you to make informed, contextual decisions about both proactive and reactive security activities.</p><p>But what it does mean is that, under the right circumstances, an internal effort to create a proprietary threat intelligence capability can be an excellent use of resources.</p><p>Do you have a need that isnt serviced by the market? Then perhaps its time to solve your own problem.</p><p>Imagine, for instance, that you develop a crawler to analyze the (web) page code of the organizations top 5,000 daily Internet destinations. Each day this crawler will provide tangible data points, which over time become an extremely effective mechanism for identifying drive-by attacks, or other anomalous activity.</p><p>This is the sort of valuable threat intelligence that youll never receive from an off-the-shelf solution, but which could potentially help you prevent (or minimize the impact of) future breaches.</p><p>Not only that, if you develop the solution in-house, youll be honing skillsets that could become extremely handy in the future.</p><p><strong>Action</strong>: Develop in-house cyber security capabilities.<br /><strong>Result</strong>: Threat intelligence thats tailored to your environment.</p><h3 id=\"use-real-world-scenarios\">Use Real-World Scenarios</h3><p>Running real-world, or proof of concept (POC) exercises is truly a sign of next-level security.</p><p>You may <em>technically</em> be prepared for certain threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), but until youve done it in practice you never really know.</p><p>Thats where your red team comes in.</p><p>The idea is to employ real-world TTPs in a controlled environment to see what affect they would have in your environment. And when you start doing this, you might be surprised by the results.</p><p>That malware you thought you were safe from? Turns out that when deployed in your environment it has a completely unexpected side effect that you might not be prepared to resolve.</p><p>By engaging in rigorous red team testing procedures, you can identify these little surprises ahead of time, and greatly improve your organizations defensive capability.</p><p>Now, of course, building these real-world scenarios and measuring the effectiveness of your defensive controls requires time and resources. If you want real results, this is not something that can be dumped on already-busy security professionals.</p><p>But if you really want to develop a world-class security facility, rigorously and routinely testing your defensive capabilities is an absolute must.</p><p><strong>Action</strong>: Use POC exercises to rigorously test your defensive capabilities.<br /><strong>Result</strong>: Greater understanding of the potential impact a breach might have on your environment.</p><h3 id=\"proactive-beats-reactive-every-time\">Proactive Beats Reactive Every Time</h3><p>Youve noticed, no doubt, that each of the approaches suggested above is highly proactive.</p><p>And theres a good reason for that.</p><p>Threat actor TTPs continue to evolve, and simply <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/31/technology/security/antivirus/\" rel=\"noopener\">building a wall</a> around your assets is no longer enough to keep them out.

The credential theft component masquerades as a Microsoft registration form for the 2022 Sir Bani Yas Forum hosted by the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The threat activity is highly likely indicative of a broader campaign that makes use of URL shorteners to direct victims to malicious pages where credentials are stolen. This tradecraft is common among Iran-nexus advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like APT42 and Phosphorus.</p><p>Insikt Group identified 5 domains highly likely used to host credential theft pages. The credential theft examples associated with this research were submitted to urlscan throughout 2022. The most recent submission was from the UAE on November 3, 2022.

The project, known as the <a href=\"https://thepeoplesmap.net/project/cambodia-china-comprehensive-investment-and-development-pilot-zone-dara-sakor-seashore-resort\">CambodiaChina Comprehensive Investment and Development Pilot Zone and Dara Sakor Seashore Resort</a> (; hereafter, the Pilot Zone), began in 2008 and <a href=\"https://archive.ph/PvqZd\">became</a> part of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2016. The Pilot Zone was originally led by the now-sanctioned Cambodia-based project lead, Union Development Group (UDG Cambodia; ;     ), a close affiliate or subsidiary of China-based developer Tianjin Union Development Group (UDG Tianjin; ). Yet, in spite of US sanctions, development continues under a new company created in 2018 amid rising negative press and under new branding adopted after UDG Cambodia was sanctioned in late 2020. The new company and brand are almost certainly still closely linked to the original developers.</p><p>Around the time when UDG Cambodia was <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1121\">sanctioned</a>, a major concern expressed by the US Treasury Department and other parts of the US government was the potential of the project to host Chinese military assets or even <a href=\"https://archive.ph/ztjHP\">become</a> a military base. There is no specific evidence the Pilot Zone is being shaped for military purposes and not even the first of 3 planned ports that could support Chinese warships is completed, making it unlikely to have such a function in the near future. However, China <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/46/4/9/111175/Pier-Competitor-China-s-Power-Position-in-Global?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">uses</a> commercial ports and port-city projects developed by Chinese companies to project naval power far from Chinas shores. Given the Pilot Zones broad scope  <a href=\"http://www.coastalcitygroup.net\">including</a> tourist resorts, <a href=\"https://archive.ph/GA9jL\">industry parks</a>, medical facilities, and ports and an international airport large <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23968248-43a0-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d\">enough</a> to <a href=\"https://archive.ph/J9Wck\">accommodate</a> military assets  and 99-year development timeline, it is prudent to monitor the projects continuing progress.</p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>Despite US sanctions, construction and other forms of development continue within the Pilot Zone, particularly at tourist attractions such as new shopping districts and the Dara Sakor International Airport.</li><li>Since early 2018, development in the zone has also focused on basic infrastructure such as establishing power and telecommunications and setting up partnerships to advance the non-tourism aspects of the Pilot Zone. </li><li>In addition to a 10,000-ton pier (port) for cruise liners and commercial goods that is said to be completed (though it almost certainly is not), plans for the Pilot Zone now include 2 additional ports, 1 of which will reportedly accommodate 100,000-ton vessels.</li><li>In mid-2018, a new company in the UDG family was created and now likely leads development of the Pilot Zone; originally called Union City Development Group Co. Ltd., this company adopted a new name  Coastal City Development Group Co.  after UDG Cambodia was sanctioned.</li><li>Although the Pilot Zone is not overtly designed to provide logistical support to Chinas military, this potential cannot be dismissed as Chinese analysts continue espousing the use of commercial port and port-city developments to facilitate Chinas power projection.</li></ul><h4 id=\"a-controversial-project\">A Controversial Project</h4><h5 id=\"sanctions-and-corruption\">Sanctions and Corruption</h5><p>From the size of the land concession on which it sits, to the developers treatment of local residents, to environmental concerns, the Pilot Zone has been stalked by controversy for over a decade. At 45,100 <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5ad5e20ef950b777a94b55c3/1523966489456/Harbored+Ambitions.pdf\">hectares</a>, the Pilot Zone constitutes 20% of Cambodias coastline and is 4.5 times the legal size of economic land concessions in Cambodia. Cambodian officials and international human rights bodies have <a href=\"https://archive.ph/UjFqW\">expressed</a> <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1121\">concern</a> about land disputes with Cambodians living in the zone. The US Treasury Department sanctioned project developer UDG Cambodia in September 2020 under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, though some analysts <a href=\"https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/220614_Poling_Pariah_Partner.pdf?KmblgE_l1bKt42yaWwkrvRaw82aoIwdn\">argue</a> this was primarily motivated by a desire to punish Cambodia for strategic alignment with China rather than concern about human rights. Regardless, the company remains sanctioned today (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p><p><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_1_f27a386449.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1: The Pilot Zone and surrounding transport corridors (Source: <em><a href=\"https://archive.ph/KGDOQ\">BeyondRealty Asia</a></em>)</strong></p><p><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_2_549b228f0b.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 2: UDG Cambodia listed in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Treasury Department, accessed July 2022 (Source: <a href=\"https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov\">OFAC</a>)</strong></p><p>Cambodian law <a href=\"https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/topics/concessions/#return-note-73837-44\">limits</a> economic land concessions to 10,000 hectares and stipulates that the same person or legal entity cannot hold several concessions that total more than 10,000 hectares. Moreover, economic land concessions are only supposed to be <a href=\"https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/topics/state-private-land\">granted</a> from state private land. The Pilot Zones creation circumvented both of these requirements. Not only is the zone overlarge, it includes a portion of Cambodias Botum Sakor National Park that was <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5ad5e20ef950b777a94b55c3/1523966489456/Harbored+Ambitions.pdf\">converted</a> into concession-eligible land by a royal decree. Some sources <a href=\"https://cambodia.ohchr.org/~cambodiaohchr/sites/default/files/news/WebDOCs/2012/SR_report_on_ELC_Eng.pdf\">say</a> the entirety of the original 36,000 hectares was carved from Botum Sakor National Park, driving concerns about <a href=\"https://www.policyforum.net/deforestation-in-cambodia\">deforestation</a> in relation to the Pilot Zones development.</p><p>How UDG Tianjin and UDG Cambodia managed to secure an economic land concession flouting both of the restrictions discussed above is unclear. When the US Treasury Department sanctioned UDG Cambodia, it <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1121\">asserted</a> the company had manipulated its corporate identity as described above to acquire the Pilot Zones land. This manipulation was first <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5ad5e20ef950b777a94b55c3/1523966489456/Harbored+Ambitions.pdf\">documented</a> in a public report by former C4ADS analysts Devin Thorne and Ben Spevack. Using Cambodian corporate records, they showed how UDG Cambodia was initially registered as a foreign-owned Chinese firm but changed its status to that of a domestic Cambodian firm 1 year prior to signing the Pilot Zones lease agreement with the Cambodian government. After the lease agreement was concluded, UDG Cambodia issued 1,000 shares valued at $1,000 USD each. All of these were purchased by UDG Tianjin in China. UDG Cambodias chairperson at the time, a Cambodian national, was also replaced by a Chinese national with ties to UDG Tianjins parent company. However, Thorne and Spevack noted that the purpose of this manipulation was unclear, given that there is no exception for Cambodian-owned businesses regarding the 10,000-hectare limit on economic land concessions.</p><p><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-3.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_3_9cef16362c.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 3: Changes to the corporate record of UDG Cambodia (Source: <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5ad5e20ef950b777a94b55c3/1523966489456/Harbored+Ambitions.pdf\">C4ADS</a>)</strong></p><p>In 2012, a report submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on the human rights situation in Cambodia by a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia <a href=\"https://cambodia.ohchr.org/~cambodiaohchr/sites/default/files/news/WebDOCs/2012/SR_report_on_ELC_Eng.pdf\">expressed</a> concern over treatment of local citizens living within the Pilot Zone. It documents the relocation of approximately 1,000 families and the struggles they faced after relocation, including limited options for generating income and poor compensation for their repurposed land. It states that UDG Cambodia hired guards to control access to villages from which some residents refused to relocate. In 2015, such guards reportedly <a href=\"https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/villagers-file-complaint-against-union-development-group-razing-crops-property\">burned</a> crops and homes built by people on seemingly unused land. As late as 2017, the company reportedly <a href=\"https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/chinese-firm-builds-fence-around-koh-kong-elc-while-families-refuse-move\">constructed</a> fences around properties owned by a small number of residents still resisting relocation. In 2019, the representatives of 140 displaced families <a href=\"https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/chinese-embassy-petitioned\">protested</a> outside of the Chinese Embassy, requesting promised compensation that they reportedly had yet to receive. As of October 2021, some Cambodian families were still <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/land-10142021160422.html\">refusing</a> compensation for their land, believing the compensation amounts to be unfair. In November 2021, more than 1,000 families <a href=\"https://cambojanews.com/while-hundreds-sign-final-offer-for-decade-plus-koh-kong-land-dispute-holdouts-remain\">agreed</a> to a compensation package, but some continued to express dissatisfaction.</p><p>The US Treasury Departments press release announcing sanctions on UDG Cambodia further <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1121\">asserted</a> the company used Cambodian military forces to intimidate local villagers and to clear out land necessary for developing the Pilot Zone. These military forces and UDG Cambodia reportedly used violent means, despite calls by the Cambodian Council of Ministers and United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for the company to stop such activities. The US Treasury Departments announcement further asserts that use of Cambodian military personnel was arranged through General <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/22/cambodia-hun-sen-and-his-abusive-generals\">Kun Kim</a>, a former high-ranking military leader who has also been <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm849\">sanctioned</a> by the US government. Both the 2012 report to the UNGA and US Treasury Departments press release also mention concerns regarding environmental degradation caused, or that could be caused, by the Pilot Zones development.</p><h5 id=\"potential-military-use\">Potential Military Use</h5><p>A recurring question posed by <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/hiding-in-plain-sight-chinese-expansion-in-southeast-asia\">foreign analysts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/22/world/asia/cambodia-china-military-bases.html\">news media</a>, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5ad5e20ef950b777a94b55c3/1523966489456/Harbored+Ambitions.pdf\">C4ADSs report</a>, and the <a href=\"https://archive.ph/ztjHP\">US government</a> related to the Pilot Zone is whether it could host Chinese military assets in the future or otherwise support Chinas military activities in Southeast Asia. There is no specific evidence that the Pilot Zone is being designed as a military base or for military use, and Cambodian <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-says-beijing-backed-project-will-not-include-chinese-naval-base/4662652.html\">officials</a> <a href=\"https://www.voacambodia.com/a/claims-port-will-be-Chinese-naval-base-unfounded-officials-say/4661805.html\">deny</a> that such is a possibility. Still, <a href=\"https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=cmsi-maritime-reports\">theories</a> among military analysts in China regarding the role of commercial ports in extending Chinas military presence overseas and the characteristics of infrastructure in the Pilot Zone keep speculation alive  and make it prudent to keep an eye on the project. Adding fuel to such concerns, a likely Chinese military-model aerial drone was reportedly <a href=\"https://archive.ph/SXQ46\">found</a> 7 kilometers outside of the Pilot Zone in January 2020.</p><p><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-4.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_4_82b4f139b2.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 4: Mentions of the Pilot Zone as tracked in the Recorded Future Platform (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><p>Concerns regarding whether the Pilot Zone could be used by the Chinese military are informed by the value of dual-use commercial port and port-city infrastructure in supporting the logistics needs (replenishment, personnel and equipment transfer, etc.) of Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) warships operating far from Chinas shores. A major concept in this line of thinking is strategic strongpoints (), which authoritative sources <a href=\"https://nuke.fas.org/guide/china/sms-2013.pdf\">refer</a> to as locations that <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/strategic-strong-points-and-chinese-naval-strategy\">provide</a> support for overseas military operations or act as a forward base for deploying military forces overseas. Researchers affiliated with the China Maritime Studies Institute <a href=\"https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=cmsi-maritime-reports\">find</a> that strategic strongpoints are often marked by Chinese-led port projects involving commercial and infrastructure projects with dual-use functions that can enable both economic and military activities. Such dual-use strongpoints are situated in strategic locations, such as along sea lines of communication or near maritime chokepoints. An assessment in the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys <em>International Security</em> journal asserts that commercial port facilities <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/46/4/9/111175/Pier-Competitor-China-s-Power-Position-in-Global?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">enable</a> considerable military logistics and intelligence capabilities in peacetime, though their utility in wartime is uncertain.</p><p>Not all Chinese-led commercial or infrastructure projects are strategic strongpoints. Given the Pilot Zones current stage and state of development, it is unlikely to support PLAN operations in the short term. However, the Pilot Zones characteristics and long development timeline mean it could evolve to meet the logistics of Chinese naval operations in Southeast Asia, such as around the Malacca Strait and into the Indian Ocean. Analysis <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5ad5e20ef950b777a94b55c3/1523966489456/Harbored+Ambitions.pdf\">highlighted</a> by C4ADS report from China-based <em>Journal of International Security Studies</em> (), described a first civilian, later military () approach to make [Chinese-owned] ports gradually possess the capability for offering logistical support to Chinese vessels and become Chinas strategic [strongpoints] in Southeast Asia to create an advantageous external environment for Chinas rise. Such an approach is seen in the multipurpose port and related infrastructure in Gwadar, Pakistan, which are being developed as part of the BRIs China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and are <a href=\"http://www.andrewerickson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CMSI_China-Maritime-Report_7_Gwadar-Chinas-Potential-Strategic-Strongpoint-in-Pakistan_Kardon-Kennedy-Dutton_20200801.pdf\">viewed</a> by Chinese analysts as suited for evolution into a strategic strongpoint. Importantly, the Pilot Zone does not need to develop into a military base in the traditional sense to be useful for expanding the geographic scope of PLAN operations. Commercial ports can and have <a href=\"https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/china/ChinaPerspectives-7.pdf\">functioned</a> as pit stops to provide basic services such as refueling, provisioning, electrical power, and waste disposal for PLAN surface vessels.</p><p><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-5.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_5_182cab33c7.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 5: The Pilot Zone in relation to Ream Naval Base with proposed and actual port positions. The outline of the Pilot Zone is based on official marketing materials but is not authoritative (Source: Google Earth, December 2020; Created by Insikt Group)</strong></p><p>Highlighting Chinas likely assessment that Cambodias geographic position has strategic value, in June 2022 the Washington Post reported that China is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/06/cambodia-china-navy-base-ream\">building</a> a naval facility for its exclusive use at Ream Naval Base in Preah Sihanouk province. The Pilot Zone is located roughly 35 nautical miles by sea and 180 miles by land from Ream Naval Base. When PLAN ships call at foreign ports, Chinese diplomatic missions and Chinese enterprises <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2022-0310.pdf\">mobilize</a> to provide logistical support. While it is most likely that Chinese enterprises located in Sihanoukville would be enrolled to provide such support, it is also plausible that some general supply and equipment warehousing could occur in the Pilot Zone even if PLAN vessels call at Ream, or that companies from the zone could mobilize to provide support. Chinese military personnel have also <a href=\"https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/china/ChinaPerspectives-7.pdf\">noted</a> the role that commercial ports can play in accessing rest and entertainment and medical treatment, and the Pilot Zone will ultimately provide options for this type of activity regardless of where PLAN ships dock (if the zones development continues according to plan).</p><p>The Pilot Zones airport and ports are also large enough to support Chinese military assets, fueling concerns. Foreign analysts have <a href=\"https://archive.ph/J9Wck\">observed</a> the Pilot Zones airport runway is about 3,400 meters long, which is larger than the international airport in Phnom Penh and could accommodate any plane in the Chinese air force. In fact, this is longer than Sihanouk International Airports runway and those of Chinas dual-use military airfields on Woody Island and on Fiery Cross Reef in the South China Sea, as some <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/hiding-in-plain-sight-chinese-expansion-in-southeast-asia\">observers</a> have pointed out. Yet others <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/32182/satellite-imagery-doesnt-support-conclusion-that-new-cambodian-airfield-is-a-chinese-base\">stress</a> this length is not uncommon at airports that will be able to accommodate airliners, especially in an area of the world that experiences high temperatures year-round. There are no other indications the airport is designed for military use.</p><p>Researchers further <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23968248-43a0-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d\">assessed</a> in 2016 that a 10,000-ton pier (port) within the Pilot Zone would be large enough to host Chinese frigates and destroyers. At approximately 207 meters in length, the dock, which sits in 11-meter deep waters, could likely service 1 such vessel at a time based on the <a href=\"https://www.oni.navy.mil/Portals/12/Intel%20agencies/China_Media/2020_China_Recce_Poster_UNCLAS.jpg?ver=2020-02-19-081430-327\">2019-2020 Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Forces Recognition and Identification Guide</a> produced by the US Navys Office of Naval Intelligence. As discussed below, however, the Pilot Zone is now envisioned to include 2 additional deep-water ports. Outside of the tourist areas, most of the Pilot Zone is still at the conceptual stage and there are conflicting reports about the specifications of these other 2 ports. Some sources <a href=\"https://archive.ph/zZVgp\">claim</a> there will be 2 additional 10,000-ton ports, others <a href=\"https://archive.ph/14PHH\">point</a> to a 100,000-ton general port (10), and some non-company materials <a href=\"https://thepeoplesmap.net/project/cambodia-china-comprehensive-investment-and-development-pilot-zone-dara-sakor-seashore-resort\">claim</a> (without citation) that 1 of the additional ports will be a 2,000-ton port. In any case, it is likely that at least 1 of the additional ports will increase the amount of space that could theoretically be used by PLAN ships.</p><h4 id=\"the-project-continues\">The Project Continues</h4><p>In spite of US sanctions and speculation regarding its potential for military-use, the Pilot Zone has continued to develop since 2017. Basic infrastructure has expanded, new developments within the zone have been approved and begun construction, and the international airport inches closer to its grand opening. This work is now likely spearheaded by a new firm in the UDG family: Coastal City Development Group Co. (CCDG; ;     .). This company initially formed under a different name just after C4ADS published its report in early 2018 but adopted the CCDG name after UDG Cambodia was sanctioned.</p><p>In March 2022, the China-based Global Times tabloid <a href=\"https://archive.ph/JO2J3\">reported</a> that CCDG is now the project developer of the Pilot Zone on behalf of Chinese developer Union Development Group. Global Times does not specify UDG Tianjin or UDG Cambodia. Cambodian corporate records show that CCDG was initially established as Union City Development Group Co. Ltd. (    .) in July 2018. Insikt Group cannot say when plans to establish this company were formed, but its creation occurred several months after C4ADS report was published, which likely stimulated <a href=\"https://archive.ph/ztjHP\">additional</a> <a href=\"https://archive.ph/GLiSu\">negative</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/r-in-cambodia-stalled-chinese-casino-resort-embodies-silk-road-secrecy-risks-2018-6\">attention</a> directed toward the Pilot Zone amid ongoing <a href=\"https://archive.ph/VFh6y\">coverage</a> of the longstanding land disputes.</p><p>In December 2020, just months after US sanctions were placed on UDG Cambodia, Union City Development in Cambodia changed its name to CCDG. The new identity distances this new member of the UDG family from the Union brand, though only in name. CCDG is <a href=\"https://archive.ph/II5g3\">registered</a> as a foreign Chinese company according to the records of Cambodias Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction. Although it is a separate commercial entity, CCDG is almost certainly closely linked to UDG Cambodia and UDG Tianjin. With CCDGs creation, the primary tourism-oriented development area within the Pilot Zone is now called Coastal City, rather than Dara Sakor. This can be seen in the logos on UDG Cambodias website (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>). This Coastal City logo also appears on CCDGs website. Highlighting the link between this CCDG and UDG Tianjin, the latter <a href=\"https://archive.ph/UTWeY\">changed</a> its name to Tianjin Union City Development Group Co. () in February 2022 (which is highly similar to CCDGs original name).</p><p><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-6a.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_6a_c73956025b.png\" /><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-6b.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_6b_1af80189a4.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 6: CCDG corporate registration record showing name change in December 2020 (Source: Cambodian Ministry of Commerce, Department of Business Registration)</strong></p><p><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-7a.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_7a_8f73749cb5.png\" /><img alt=\"despite-us-sanctions-large-scale-belt-and-road-initiative-project-in-cambodia-forges-ahead-figure-7b.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/despite_us_sanctions_large_scale_belt_and_road_initiative_project_in_cambodia_forges_ahead_figure_7b_965d61c1a4.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 7: The logo on UDG Cambodias website in 2018 (left) as compared to the logo in 2022 (right) (Source: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181214003408/http://www.union-groupcompany.com:80/webpage/ch/cms/index/index_1.shtml\">UDG Cambodia 2018</a>; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181214003408/http://www.union-groupcompany.com:80/webpage/ch/cms/index/index_1.shtml\">UDG Cambodia 2022</a>)</strong></p><p>The overall plan for developing the Pilot Zone is largely the same as it was several years ago, but updated marketing materials use new names for some sub-projects in the Pilot Zone and provide additional details.

Each of these districts will be further subdivided into specialized zones and specific projects as depicted in earlier materials.

They also show that medical and wellness facilities, including multiple hospitals (the largest having 500 to 800 <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220608112346/http://www.coastalcitygroup.net/business.aspx?type=22\">beds</a>), spa services and yoga providers, and access to Chinese traditional medicine; and education facilities, including a vocational school and international school, remain part of the zones vision. At least 1 marketing image, <a href=\"https://archive.ph/KGDOQ\">hosted</a> on a realty website, suggests the Coastal City World Trade New District will include a Permanent Site for [the] ASEAN Forum. It is important to note that while UDG Cambodia owns the lease and CCDG is now a major, perhaps leading, contributor in developing the Pilot Zone, many other companies are also, or will be, <a href=\"https://thepeoplesmap.net/project/cambodia-china-comprehensive-investment-and-development-pilot-zone-dara-sakor-seashore-resort\">involved</a> as partners and investors.

This evokes images of China building a series of permanent installations with hardened facilities similar to those of the US. Although there are differing assessments as to whether China is seeking or will, under certain conditions, seek to establish formal military bases beyond its current <a href=\"https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=cmsi-maritime-reports\">logistics base</a> in Djibouti, China is very likely to continue <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/46/4/9/111175/Pier-Competitor-China-s-Power-Position-in-Global?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">employing</a> a <a href=\"https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/china/ChinaPerspectives-7.pdf\">pit stop</a> model that <a href=\"https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/Books/beyond-borders/990-059-NDU-PLA_Beyond_Borders_sp_jm14.pdf\">uses</a> commercial port facilities to support the military logistics needs of operations other than war.

It will be of most interest to Taiwans government and military, governments and militaries active in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as researchers who focus on Chinas military and cyber activities. The reports authors, Devin Thorne and Zoe Haver, thank Jessica Drun and Joe McReynolds for their generous reviews and support. Information about the authors can be found at the end of the report.</p><h4 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h4><p>The leadership of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) firmly believes that Taiwan (ROC) belongs to China. Despite the fact that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC, the Chinese party-state has long sought reunification with Taiwan, describing reunification as a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, indispensable for the realization of China's rejuvenation, and a historic mission of the Communist Party of China. In support of this objective, China has consistently attempted to influence Taiwans behavior, including through coercive diplomatic, economic, and military activity.</p><p>Furthermore, Chinas party-state has vowed to oppose separatist forces and external interference by the United States, emphasizing that China will strive for peaceful reunification with Taiwan but will always be ready to respond with the use of force or other necessary means to interference by external forces or radical action by separatist elements. This is not an empty threat: the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) has long prioritized preparations for a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan, and the PLA is actively pursuing the capabilities that it needs to successfully carry out such an invasion.</p><p>With a focus on Taiwan scenarios, this report assesses how the PLA and other relevant actors in China conceptualize and execute cyber coercion and cyber warfare. The report analyzes Chinas theory of cyber coercion in general and in cross-strait relations, as well as Chinas theory of cyber warfare and cyber activity in cross-strait conflict scenarios. The report then surveys Chinas network forces and examines Chinas efforts to prepare for and execute peacetime and wartime cyber activity, focusing on network forces development, network reconnaissance, and network attacks.</p><p>We find that, during peacetime, China is very likely to use network coercion to compel the cessation of perceived pro-independence activities or deter any perceived moves by Taiwan toward independence. During wartime joint landing or blockade campaigns against Taiwan, China would almost certainly engage in network warfare to help seize information dominance, with major targets being military and civilian information systems as well as critical infrastructure. We judge that Chinas efforts to carry out network forces development, network reconnaissance, and network attacks are equally relevant to peacetime cyber coercion and wartime cyber operations. China is leveraging universities, private enterprises, hacking competitions, cyber ranges, and other means in a whole-of-nation effort to develop weapons and talent for use in both peacetime and wartime network operations. China-linked cyber threat actors have also demonstrated a willingness to use network scanning, phishing, domain spoofing, zero-days, and other tools to carry out network reconnaissance, likely aiming to acquire intelligence and prepare for network attacks. Moreover, China-linked cyber threat actors have already carried out ransomware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), and defacement attacks against Taiwan during peacetime and have revealed an interest in attacking adversaries critical infrastructure.</p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>China very likely views the use of cyber capabilities as an option for compelling the Taiwanese government or public to cease perceived pro-independence activities or deterring perceived moves toward Taiwanese independence.</li><li>If China decides to use force against Taiwan, cyber capabilities would almost certainly be used to seek information dominance as part of joint landing or blockade campaigns.</li><li>Chinas network forces available for use in coercion and war include armed forces units, the personnel of civilian government organizations, and civilians in technology enterprises, and likely also hobbyists or patriotic hackers.</li><li>China almost certainly views the full range of cyber attack and technical network investigation tools found in the military and civilian spheres as applicable in coercion and war.</li><li>Network weapons and talent development pipelines in China include military weapons development and training programs, civilian educational programs and recruitment, and national efforts to build cyber ranges.</li><li>China very likely views network reconnaissance, including network inspection and espionage, as an ever-present form of struggle, and has considerable capabilities for carrying out such activity.</li><li>Based on observed cases, Chinas approach to cyber-enabled espionage prioritizes targeting mid-level and high-level telecommunications infrastructure from which threat actors can collect data on a range of more specific targets.</li><li>Chinas objectives for cyber war and coercion almost certainly include disrupting, damaging, or destroying the function of military and civilian information systems and critical infrastructure, as well as shocking Taiwanese decision-makers and weakening their will to fight.</li></ul><h4 id=\"sources\">Sources</h4><p>This report is organized around theoretical discussions of Chinas approach to cyber coercion and warfare as well as evidence of Chinas cyber capabilities in practice. The theoretical sections of this report draw heavily from authoritative PLA textbooks published by the Academy of Military Science (AMS; ) and National Defense University (NDU; ). These include NDUs <em>Science of Campaigns</em> (published in 2006), the 2013 edition of AMSs <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> (hereafter SMS 2013), the 2017 edition of NDUs <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> (SMS 2017), and the 2020 edition of NDUs <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> (SMS 2020).</p><p>AMS and NDU are Chinas two premier defense institutes, and foreign experts assess their various editions of <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> to be core textbooks for senior PLA officers on how wars should be planned and conducted at the strategic level. The 2001 edition AMSs <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> is believed to have been used to educate senior PLA decision-makers, including those on the [Central Military Commission], as well as officers who may become Chinas future strategic planners. <em>Science of Campaigns</em> has also been an important educational text used for teaching campaign theory. These edited volumes are not official descriptions of Chinas military doctrine but are generally believed to provide insight into the PLAs evolving thinking on various doctrinal challenges. When possible, we supplement our reading of these major PLA volumes with analysis of journal articles authored by personnel from Chinese cyber-related military and civilian organizations.</p><h4 id=\"cyber-coercion\">Cyber Coercion</h4><p>This section discusses Chinas theory of cyber coercion and the potential for China to use cyber coercion against Taiwan in peacetime, which China could very likely use in an effort to counter perceived moves toward Taiwanese independence. Coercion comprises 2 distinct theories of action to change the behavior of a target: deterrence and compellence. Deterrence uses the threat of punishment to prevent undesirable actions, and compellence wields punishment to motivate desirable actions (or cessation of undesirable actions). Coercion can take many forms, including diplomatic, economic, and military. States can also carry out coercion through cyber means, though experts question its effectiveness.</p><h5 id=\"chinas-network-coercion-theory\">Chinas Network Coercion Theory</h5><p>The 2 elements of coercion, compellence and deterrence, are captured by a single word in Mandarin: <em>weishe</em> (). The 2001 edition of the <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> defines <em>weishe</em> as the military conduct of a state or political group in displaying force or showing the determination to use force to compel the enemy to submit to ones volition and refrain from taking hostile actions or escalating  hostility. Although SMS 2013 is less explicit, the PLA almost certainly continues to view theories of <em>weishe</em> as allowing for what foreign observers call compellence rather than deterrence alone. However, official English translations of Chinese military texts and government-issued white papers on defense strategy translate <em>weishe</em> only as deterrence. Below, we use <em>weishe</em> for clarity.</p><p><em>Weishe</em> is both a peacetime and wartime activity, though primarily a peacetime activity given that its fundamental aim is to prevent the outbreak of war or escalation of threats. As a foreign PLA expert summarizes, <em>weishe</em> is to be employed both before and after fighting begins, preferably to avoid war, but also to avoid horizontal escalation (to other regions or strategic directions) or vertical escalation (up the spectrum of violence, especially to nuclear war). SMS 2013 asserts that the basic goal of <em>weishe</em> is to contain a possible offensive from the opponent, maintain the status, or stop activities that endanger oneself from happening. Crucially, activities that endanger oneself (that is, China) almost certainly include threats other than war, such as threats to Chinas political security and development interests.</p><p><em>Weishe</em> is also an explicitly political endeavor that involves both military and non-military activity. SMS 2013 stresses that <em>weishe</em> aims to achieve political goals, is subordinate to politics, and requires the use of diplomatic, political, military, economic, science and technology, and other means. Likewise, SMS 2017 says that in peacetime, the major role of strategic <em>weishe</em> is the application of national military, political, economic, cultural, diplomatic, and other strategic forces to influence a state of affairs. The implication is that <em>weishe</em> is a whole-of-government effort and civilian entities are very likely involved in activities to support integrated-whole _weishe_ () alongside any action the military may take.</p><p>The range of specific issues in response to which the PLA and the Chinese government may conduct <em>weishe</em>, whether military or non-military, is not explicitly listed in any texts reviewed by Recorded Future. However, Chinas 2019 white paper titled Chinas National Defense in the New Era, which was issued by the State Council Information Office, identifies the points listed below as goals of national defense broadly. We believe that this represents a relatively comprehensive list of objectives to which coercive capabilities  up to and including the threat of war  could be applied.</p><ul><li>To oppose and contain Taiwan independence</li><li>To deter and resist aggression</li><li>To safeguard national political security, the peoples security and social stability</li><li>To crack down on proponents of separatist movements such as Tibet independence and the creation of East Turkistan (that is, an independent Xinjiang)</li><li>To safeguard national sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity, and security</li><li>To safeguard Chinas maritime rights and interests</li><li>To safeguard Chinas security interests in outer space, electromagnetic space, and cyberspace</li><li>To safeguard Chinas overseas interests</li><li>To support the sustainable development of the country</li></ul><p>Although China almost certainly views <em>weishe</em> as a strategic concept applicable to many threats, the majority of PLA and civilian texts reviewed by Recorded Future define cyber coercion, or network <em>weishe</em> (), only with regard to the goal of deterring or responding to cyberattacks from an adversary. SMS 2013, for example, asserts that the goal of network <em>weishe</em> is specifically to forcibly prevent the adversary from daring to willfully carry out large-scale network attacks and severe sabotage, principally from hostile nations or terrorist organizations. The focus is on <em>weishe</em> in kind  rather than the use of cross-domain <em>weishe</em>. However, SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 also stress that network warfare should be integrated with struggles in the political, diplomatic, economic, and other domains to serve Chinas overall strategic goals. Likewise, some non-authoritative sources, such as a 2019 article in <em>China Information Security</em> ()  which is affiliated with Chinas leading civilian intelligence service, the Ministry of State Security (MSS; )  explicitly acknowledge that network <em>weishe</em> is a kind of cross-domain <em>weishe</em> strategy naturally integrated with the pursuit of state goals in other domains.</p><p>Even if network <em>weishe</em> is limited to countering threats in cyberspace, the scope of what constitutes a threat is likely quite large. Chinas national defense goals include defending the countrys security interests in  cyberspace. Released in 2016 by the Cyberspace Administration of China, Chinas National Cyberspace Security Strategy offers insight into what types of online threats network <em>weishe</em> might address in a section discussing the severe challenges facing China. These include threats to Chinas political system, economy, culture, society, and national defense.</p><h5 id=\"cyber-coercion-in-cross-strait-relations\">Cyber Coercion in Cross-Strait Relations</h5><p>China could decide to carry out cyber coercion against Taiwan in an attempt to influence the behavior of the Taiwanese government or Taiwanese political parties, such as to compel the cessation of perceived pro-independence activities or to deter perceived moves toward Taiwanese independence. Indeed, China has likely already carried out cyber coercion against Taiwan, though it is often difficult to conclusively attribute a coercive motive to alleged Chinese cyber activity.</p><p>An instance of cyber coercion likely occurred in response to the visit of Nancy Pelosi, the US Speaker of the House of Representatives, to Taiwan in August 2022, when large-scale cyber attacks allegedly emanating from China hit Taiwan. The attackers, who cybersecurity analysts believe were likely hacktivists rather than Chinas core network forces (discussed further in the <strong>Chinas Network Forces</strong> section below), reportedly targeted government websites, utility and transportation websites, infrastructure like railway station screens, and screens in 7-Eleven convenience stores with DDoS attacks and other cyberattacks. Cyber threat activity targeting Taiwan reportedly began increasing as early as July 29, 10 days after the possibility of Pelosis visit was publicly reported and 2 days after the first on-the-record confirmation from a member of the US Congress that Pelosi had indeed invited other legislators to join such a trip. Citing Taiwanese Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang, news organizations reported that the volume of cyber attacks on Taiwan government units on [August 2], before and during Pelosi's arrival, surpassed 15,000 gigabits, 23 times higher than the previous daily record. The Taiwanese authorities did not directly attribute the attacks to the Chinese government but did indicate that the attacks on government websites originated from IP addresses in China and Russia. The attacks reportedly did little damage as a result of Taiwanese cybersecurity mitigations. This cyber activity coincided with more easily attributable, non-cyber forms of coercion such as military exercises and missile tests.</p><h4 id=\"cyber-warfare\">Cyber Warfare</h4><p>This section analyzes Chinas theory of cyber warfare and the potential for China to use cyber warfare against Taiwan in conflict scenarios. We find that Chinese military strategists greatly prioritize offensive cyber action and that the PLA would almost certainly use offensive cyber means, such as computer viruses and hackers, to pursue information dominance during joint landing or blockade campaigns against Taiwan.</p><h5 id=\"chinas-network-warfare-theory\">Chinas Network Warfare Theory</h5><p>The 2017 and 2020 editions of <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> argue that networks have become the center of the multidimensional battlefield, and that operations in the network space are, without exception, the backbone of winning wars. The goal of network warfare () and network operations () is to degrade an adversarys information environment, prepare to do so through network reconnaissance (), and defend ones own information environment. The network domain involves both computer- and internet-based military operations and electromagnetic warfare operations, though this report focuses on the former. PLA writings sometimes conceptualize the network domain alongside other domains like land, sea, air, and space; in other instances, they present it as a component of the broader information domain.</p><p>The various editions of SMS largely present a consistent description of network warfares characteristics. These include emphasis on the following aspects: wide scope, hidden quality, and destructive potential. Other texts reviewed by Recorded Future as well as broader surveys of works by Chinese analysts show these views are often consistent across diverse sources.</p><ul><li><strong>Wide Scope:</strong> The battlefield scope is massive because information networks are ubiquitous in modern life and because military and civilian networks are interconnected.</li><li><strong>Hidden Quality:</strong> Attribution of an attacker or where an attack originates is exceedingly difficult to determine because network attacks are unbounded by time, place, or identity.</li><li><strong>Destructive Potential:</strong> The effects of a network attack can be devastating across military and civilian systems because the scope of the network space is so wide.</li></ul><p>SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 particularly highlight the blurred line between peace and war, noting the networks of all countries are being penetrated in peacetime. They further use Americas treatment of Iraq following the Gulf War and just prior to the 2003 Iraq War, which they claim entailed significant intelligence collection and psychological operations, as well as the use of the Stuxnet malware that targeted Irans nuclear program, to highlight how cyber warfare is defined by escalation and de-escalation in the level and scope of damage rather than the commencement and cessation of activity. These examples are also used to highlight how peacetime cyber operations can act as a forerunner to war. In other words, cyber warfare is a constant element of modern statecraft. Ye Zheng (), the first director of AMSs Informatized Warfare Research Office (), has gone as far as to argue that Chinas network warfare forces should be constantly preparing to conduct network warfare operations and be in a perpetual state of mobilization.</p><p>While Chinese military strategists and analysts discuss both the offensive and defensive aspects of network warfare, offensive capability and striking first are greatly prioritized, though SMS 2013 says defense should be the primary consideration. Network operations are seen as an asymmetric weapon for a weaker state (as China perceives itself to be in some domains) to effectively oppose a stronger, technologically advanced adversary (namely, the US). The goal of striking first is to seize information dominance, thereby capturing the initiative of a conflict. That is, China can use first strikes to gain an advantage over its adversary, and likely in an overall contest, by disrupting the ability of an adversarys information systems to effectively function. Some Chinese researchers argue that this ideology of the offensive was relatively mainstream among strategists until 2008, after which it became more tempered by a prioritization of defense. However, SMS 2017 continues to emphasize that even defense relies on actively initiated offensive operations to seize information dominance.</p><h5 id=\"cyber-activity-in-cross-strait-conflict-scenarios\">Cyber Activity in Cross-Strait Conflict Scenarios</h5><p>If China chose to use military force in pursuit of reunification with Taiwan, the PLA would very likely carry out joint landing or blockade campaigns. According to PLA campaign writings, a joint landing campaign would almost certainly involve a push for sea and air dominance in the Taiwan Strait, as well as for dominance in the information domain. The campaign would almost certainly also use key-point strikes to disrupt Taiwans defenses, including its early warning detection systems, runways and hangars, command and communications systems, missile positions, and harbors. Other components would almost certainly include rapid, continual, and concentrated assaults to penetrate Taiwans coastal defenses and logistics operations to support the amphibious forces that successfully land on Taiwan. A joint blockade campaign would almost certainly aim to sever Taiwans sea-air lanes of communication by blockading enemy ports and navigational routes, carrying out monitoring, spot inspections, seizure, and attacks at sea, and implementing airborne monitoring, expulsion, intercepts, and attacks.</p><p>Joint landing or blockade campaigns carried out by China against Taiwan would almost certainly involve cyber activity as part of operations in the information domain. <em>Science of Campaigns</em> describes campaign information warfare as permeating the entirety of campaign operations, from beginning to end, and targeting enemy information detection sources, information channels, and information processing and decision-making systems. The textbook stresses that campaign information warfare comprises both information attack and information defense, and that the former includes network, electromagnetic, and psychological attacks, as well as physical destruction. It states that network attacks (mainly via computer viruses and hackers) are invasive and destructive activities that target enemy computers and computer network systems, including command and control systems.</p><p>During a joint landing or blockade campaign, the PLA would almost certainly seek information dominance during the early stages of the campaign, which <em>Science of Campaigns</em> frames as an essential prerequisite for seizing air and sea dominance. Information dominance in a joint landing campaign requires  among other components  carrying out information suppression, which includes the use of network attacks and other tools to degrade enemy information systems information processing and decision centers, information detection sources and information channels, navigation and positioning systems, communications systems, early-warning detection systems, and anti-missile interception systems. Information dominance during a joint blockade campaign requires  among other components  carrying out information reconnaissance, which includes network-based information attacks that aim to infiltrate computer networks, break enemy information security codes, steal intelligence, implement encroachment by computer viruses, destroy enemy network operations processes, and paralyze enemy command and information systems.</p><h4 id=\"preparation-and-execution\">Preparation and Execution</h4><p>This section seeks to bridge the gap between theory and execution, surveying Chinas range of network forces and examining how China conceptualizes and then implements 3 key types of cyber activity: network forces development, network reconnaissance, and network attack. PLA writings strongly indicate that these 3 categories of activity are relevant to both peacetime cyber coercion and wartime cyber operations. SMS 2020 and SMS 2017 contend that, unlike the military struggles in other domains, network domain struggle is not limited to wartime, but is also found during political, economic, military, cultural, and science and technology struggles in peacetime. To this point, they call for the fusion of peace and war, which includes carrying out <em>weishe</em>, intimidating the adversary, constraining war, and preparing for war. Based on this evidence and observed patterns in Chinas behavior, the content discussed in this section is almost certainly applicable to Chinese cyber activity that could target Taiwan before and during a war.</p><h5 id=\"chinas-network-forces\">Chinas Network Forces</h5><p>Chinas network forces include military, government, and non-governmental entities, a combination of which is very likely to participate in a conflict over Taiwan and the preparation for such a conflict. SMS 2013 identifies 3 types of forces for network operations.</p><p>First are professional network warfare forces, which are specially trained military units such as those within the Strategic Support Forces (SSF) Network Systems Department () and other parts of the PLA. Network militias also provide a cyber capability within Chinas armed forces. </p><p>Second are authorized forces, which are local strengths that can be approved by the military to carry out network operations, such as the MSS and the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). </p><p>Third are civilian forces, which are non-governmental entities that can spontaneously carry out network attack and defense or be mobilized for network operations. SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 specify that network-electromagnetic forces can include personnel from civilian enterprises and even some hobbyists with specialized technical skills. In 2015, a researcher affiliated with AMS's Combat Theory and Regulations Research Department () described this arrangement of forces as small core, big periphery (), calling for network militias, network police, patriotic hackers, and technical personnel from commercial enterprises to complement Chinas military strength.  </p><p>Notably, the entities named in this section are the same seen in real-world examples of peacetime cyber activities emanating from China, including cyber-enabled espionage carried out by the MSS and cyber coercion carried out by likely hacktivists (see Figure 1 below).</p><p><img alt=\"from_coercion_to_invasion_the_theory_and_execution_of_china_cyber_activity_figure_1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/from_coercion_to_invasion_the_theory_and_execution_of_china_cyber_activity_figure_1_e25114d270.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1: Defacement attack carried out by self-described patriotic hacking group Panda Intelligence Bureau during the 2017 China-South Korea THAAD dispute (Source: Boan News; Panda Intelligence Bureau)</strong></p><h6 id=\"network-forces-development\">Network Forces Development</h6><p>Any significant cyber action that Chinas military or intelligence forces might take against Taiwan, or in preparation for a Taiwan conflict, would be predicated on the availability of capable forces and effective cyber weapons. While much attention is paid to newly discovered cyber intrusions targeting Taiwan, there are lessons to be learned about Chinas cyber capability, force strength and identity, and plans by investigating talent and weapons development pipelines. This section briefly outlines the preparation of Chinas network forces and tools through authoritative sources and real-world examples.</p><p>The various editions of <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> discuss development of network warfare capabilities from the perspectives of both technical research and talent cultivation, though more detail is provided for the latter. With regard to network warfare weapons, these texts urge readers (presumably PLA officers and other relevant decision-makers) to plan in advance and prepare by studying frontier trends in technology. Specific types of capabilities to develop are not discussed beyond a call for trump card [] means, but those listed in the <strong>Network Reconnaissance</strong> section below and those that would facilitate Chinas network attack objectives (discussed in the <strong>Network Attack</strong> section) are very likely candidates.</p><p>These textbooks, particularly SMS 2017 and SMS 2020, devote more time to the higher-level concern of talent cultivation. They call for training high-quality network confrontation talent with a strong understanding of technology and tactics. They further identify 4 types of network warfare talent: 1) advanced network command talent for preparing war plans; 2) staff officer talent for carrying out network confrontation tasks; 3) advanced professional talent with special skills and the ability to develop network weapons; and 4) network support talent for operational maintenance and security. According to these textbooks, Chinas network warfare forces should focus on strategy and strengthen their proactiveness, flexibility, and creativity. </p><p><strong>Whole-of-Nation Solutions</strong> <br />All editions of <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> reviewed for this study emphasize the importance of military-civil linkages in preparing for, and carrying out, struggle in the network domain. SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 stress drawing on specialized technical talent from government departments, enterprises, and society in fostering talented personnel and conducting research relevant to network warfare.</p><p>In practice, the SSFs talent development pipeline largely relies on military technical universities and research institutes, with recruitment from civilian universities also being an important avenue of talent acquisition. Network weapons development is contracted by the PLA and military educational institutions to civilian universities and information technology companies, but the massive scale of the SSFs information warfare programs requires a more controlled and regularized workforce that can only be properly maintained in-house.</p><p>The MSS appears to rely relatively more heavily on external contractors, though it has an important in-house capability as well. For example, a professor in Hainan Universitys Information Security Department allegedly worked with intelligence officers of the Hainan Province State Security Department to recruit and manage contract hackers for APT40. The professor reportedly helped establish at least one technology front company, orchestrated password cracking competitions with real-world applications among Hainan University students, and was a point of contact for recruited hackers on managerial issues like pay and benefits.</p><p>Examining military-civil and broader government-society coordination in support of Chinas network capabilities and talent development for military and intelligence purposes reveals numerous real-world examples. A selection of these demonstrating coordination among academia, business, the military, and government are discussed below. Actors from all of these sectors could play a role in a Taiwan wartime scenario, based on the conception of Chinas network forces found in SMS 2013 discussed above.</p><p>In academia, 100,000 cadres from Shanghais government and defense enterprises are learning secrets theft and anti-secrets theft skills through a training platform built by the Ministry of Education Engineering Research Center for Network Information Security Management and Services () at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (). Separately, the Southwest University of Science and Technology Net Emergency Response Team (SNERT; ) in Mianyang, Sichuan, is actually a network militia that organizes training for other militia forces that involve building battlefield local area networks, reconnaissance of enemy system services and permissions, and intelligence interception.</p><p>Among businesses, the technology enterprise-sponsored 2018 Tianfu Cup hacking competition led to the discovery of a chain of exploits in iPhones that enabled Chinas intelligence apparatus to spy on members of the Uyghur ethnic community between November 2018 and January 2019 (when Apple issued a fix). Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Ltd. (360), a cybersecurity company deeply involved in military-civil fusion programs and one of the Tianfu Cup sponsors, has at least one Beijing-based network security militia responsible, in part, for researching (and presumably carrying out if needed) forms of offensive and defensive network operations.</p><p>In military and government efforts, PLA Unit 61419 sought the purchase of multiple versions of English-language antivirus software, such as McAfee Total Protection and BitDefender Total Security, in 2019, likely for the purpose of developing their cyber capabilities. The China National Vulnerability Database of Information Security (CNNVD; ), which is affiliated with the MSS, has also likely delayed public disclosure of high-threat vulnerabilities exploited by China-linked APT groups. Relatedly, national regulations likely facilitate opportunistic cyber espionage by requiring enterprises and other entities to report any discovered vulnerabilities to the government within 2 days. The use of zero-day vulnerabilities by China-based threat actors has reportedly increased since these regulations were enacted.</p><p><strong>Training Infrastructure: Cyber Ranges</strong> <br />A specific means of developing network weapons and network warfare talent that is discussed in authoritative sources is the use of network (cyber) ranges (). These are virtual environments for training and testing cyber capabilities. The construction of network ranges is a focus area for Chinas government, and they are considered national defense mobilization resources. In addition to defensive uses, their offense-oriented use is to examine new network warfare weapons and methods, research tactics, and conduct network confrontation exercises, according to SMS 2017 and SMS 2020. In particular, they can support simulations for target scouting, information theft, network intrusion, information theft, information or service destruction, and other attack methods, as well as for evaluating the attack effects of various attacks.</p><p>A July 2022 tender from a PLA entity, likely the Xinjiang Military District (), offers a clear example of how cyber ranges are being used to develop network attack and defense skills for jamming enemy communications, infecting different operating systems, and possibly attacking critical infrastructure. The tender was for a network attack and defense range () to support team-based combat training. A stated requirement was the capability to simulate communications systems, signal patterns, and anti-jamming methods of foreign military ultrashort wave and microwave communications equipment. The cyber range was also supposed to include mobile communications network reconnaissance implanting software () that would support real-time precise interception of the calls and texts of 4G mobile phones, trojan implantation, traffic hijacking, tampering, and vulnerability analysis, among other functions. The range would further support roughly 200 virtual targets including operating systems, databases, and security equipment; around 100 common attack vectors such as vulnerability exploitation, cross-site scripting, and privilege escalation; proof of concept (PoC)-based automatic attacks (poc); and simulated scenarios such as standard enterprise structures in civil aviation, telecommunications, and transportation.</p><h6 id=\"network-reconnaissance\">Network Reconnaissance</h6><p>In line with the assessment that network penetration is a defining feature of the peacetime environment and Ye Zhengs aforementioned call for constant preparation and mobilization, the newest versions of <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> assert that intelligence collection via cyberspace is the most prominent form of confrontation during times of peace. In advance of a Taiwan scenario, whether a joint landing campaign, joint blockade, or both, China would almost certainly seek to gather up-to-date intelligence from government, military, and other targets in Taiwan. In fact, Chinas penetration of Taiwans networks for a range of purposes is likely near constant. As early as 2003, Taiwans government leaders reported that hackers in China had used 23 different trojans to infiltrate 10 technology companies, from which they infected 50 more companies and 30 government agencies. </p><p>SMS 2013 defines cyber-enabled intelligence collection, or network reconnaissance, as the use of nondestructive network exploitation to acquire private information for the purpose of preparing future network attack and defense operations. Network reconnaissance entails reconnoitering an adversarys C4ISRK, electromagnetic, and weapons control systems through network penetration (called network secrets theft []) and the retrieval of physical information storage devices with the aid of spies, third-party sellers, and other means (called media secrets theft []). SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 provide additional insight as to the intelligence to be targeted for acquisition, specifying the need for information on the enemys network systems (including structure and configuration []), information capabilities, critical nodes, vulnerabilities, strategic plans, forces, methods, and potential courses of action. Network reconnaissance, therefore, includes both technical investigation of the enemys systems and espionage, which itself is also a broader objective of network attack. Both technical reconnaissance and espionage are discussed in this section.</p><p><strong>Tools of Reconnaissance</strong> <br />SMS 2013 emphasizes that although their goals are different, the methods of network attack and defense are the same as those for network reconnaissance at the technical level. Specific network reconnaissance tactics acknowledged in this textbook include password cracking, information interception, and the use of spyware to acquire locally stored information. SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 are more vague, asserting that network reconnaissance is carried out using viruses, trojan horses, hacker software.</p><p>A 2020 paper by authors affiliated with the AMS Warfare Research Institute () and PLA Unit 31003, which may be the Joint Staff Department Network-Electronic Bureau (), identifies more than 20 common network attack methods. The paper is defense-oriented but likely reflects awareness within major Chinese military institutions of these options for probing the technical features of adversary networks. Other authors associated with AMS have explicitly advocated that some of the same tools, including sniffers and vulnerability scanners, be developed for network reconnaissance. Methods listed in the 2020 paper include: </p><ul><li>Network sniffers (), including for full text and account passwords</li><li>Network scanners (), including for location, vulnerabilities, and services</li><li>Information service exploitation (), including Finger and LDAP services</li><li>Social engineering ()</li><li>Network interception () through various methods</li><li>Network phishing (), including through IP and DNS deception, ARP attack, and email phishing</li></ul><p>Looking beyond theory, such tools are used by China-linked threat actor groups in the real world. In a 2020 indictment released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ), several cyber actors (including 2 of those involved with APT41) are alleged to have used commercially available network vulnerability scanning tools such as Acunetix and SQLMap. The indictment loosely links APT41 to the MSS. TA413 and TAG-22 (Earth Lusca) likewise use the open-source tool FScan. In addition to using off-the-shelf options, APT41-associated actors also use custom software and malware to understand their targets, such as the queryable social media repository SonarX and MESSAGETAP, which intercepts and analyzes mobile phone text messages.</p><p>Illuminating the link between Chinas strategic interests and network scanning, in 2018, Recorded Future discovered an IP address from Tsinghua University that made over 1 million connections to companies and agencies in Alaska as part of a bulk port scanning operation that immediately followed an Alaskan government delegation to China. A goal of the delegation was to negotiate a potential Alaska-China gas pipeline, and scanned targets included the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, State of Alaska Government, and various Alaskan telecommunications companies. In Taiwan, the deputy director of the Cyber Security Investigation Office of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice (), Liu Chia-zung (), warned in 2020 of China's omnipresent infiltration efforts. He asserted that since 2018, at least 10 government agencies and the email accounts of some 6,000 officials had been targeted with the goal of acquiring important government documents and data.</p><p>Other tactics on the list above have also been observed in the wild. For instance, during the 2020 US presidential election, MSS-linked RedBravo (APT31/Zirconium) targeted [Joe Biden and Donald Trump] campaign staffers personal emails with credential phishing emails and emails containing tracking links. TA423 (APT40) has been observed using social engineering tactics, posing, for example, as journalists from Australian Morning News and using email subjects like Sick Leave and Request Cooperation. More broadly, over the past 3 years, RedAlpha has been registering and weaponizing hundreds of domains spoofing organizations such as the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), Amnesty International, the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), Radio Free Asia (RFA), the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). This activity is very likely in pursuit of establishing initial access to sources of intelligence in Taiwan and elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Modes of Espionage</strong> <br />A prominent trend in Chinas cyber espionage activities, which can support technical reconnaissance as well, is the exploitation of mid-level and upper-level telecommunications infrastructure from which threat actors can pivot to more specific targets. APT41s MESSAGETAP, for example, was installed in the Short Message Service Center (SMSC) servers of network operators. Similarly, China-based threat actors target managed service providers (MSPs) globally, cloud computing infrastructure, and virtual private network (VPN) providers. According to a June 2022 advisory from the US Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, China state-sponsored threat actors also target network devices like SOHO routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices as midpoints from which to pivot attacks toward other entities. A non-telecommunications analogue of this supply chain-oriented cyber-enabled espionage activity is Chinas targeting of law firms, where acquisition of their clients data is the intended objective.</p><p>An extreme example of the trend described above is the compromise of at least 30,000 organizations by the MSS and other China-linked groups exploiting a combination of zero-days in Microsoft Exchange.  Beginning in late February 2021, thousands of attacks per day were launched to gain access to the email servers of Microsofts customers. While initially attributed to one threat activity group (HAFNIUM), multiple known and unknown China-based groups also acted on the vulnerabilities before a patch was made public, including APT27, Calypso, Websiic, and Tick Group. Tick Group has been tentatively identified as affiliated with PLA Unit 61419. Tonto Team, which is also reportedly affiliated with the PLA, began exploiting the vulnerability chain after the patch was issued. The Microsoft Exchange intrusion highlights another trend in Chinas reconnaissance activity: rushing to exploit disclosed vulnerabilities before organizations can issue fixes, as also seen after the 2018 Tianfu Cup. The rapid exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities by multiple groups, including those associated with the PLA and MSS, also lends further credence to the theory that a digital quartermaster ecosystem exists within Chinas security apparatus to distribute shared capabilities.</p><h6 id=\"network-attack\">Network Attack</h6><p>Should China decide to apply its cyber capabilities in a Taiwan wartime scenario, the force building, weapons development, and ongoing network reconnaissance activities discussed above would almost certainly culminate in destructive cyber operations against vital government, military, and civilian targets on the island. This section explores how authoritative Chinese sources conceptualize network attack and understand target selection, with lessons for where Chinas network forces might strike.</p><p><strong>Attack Objectives</strong> <br />In addition to extracting intelligence (discussed in the <strong>Network Reconnaissance</strong> section), the various editions of <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> describe the principle purpose of network attack as impairing an adversarys information systems. In language highly similar to the aforementioned details of <em>Science of Campaigns</em>, which identifies network attack as a type of information attack, SMS 2013 asserts the goal is to degrade system functions through sabotage. SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 likewise advocate destroying and paralyzing an enemys networks for command and control, communication, and the computer systems of their weapons equipment. A 2015 article in <em>China Information Security</em> argues there are 3 levels of attack with increasing severity: reduced services, damaged applications, and paralyzed systems.</p><p>Network attacks would almost certainly support Chinas pursuit of information dominance in a Taiwan scenario, especially at the start of the conflict, with the goal being to cripple the islands ability to accurately assess the battlespace and effectively mobilize resources against threats. Indeed, the 2001 version of <em>Science of Military Strategy</em> theorizes about an electronic Pearl Harbor scenario in which a network-electromagnetic strike disables an adversarys ability to engage in conventional warfare by disrupting the enemys information flows through network attacks and other means. The aforementioned Ye Zheng has further argued for integrating network and conventional weapons in the early stages of war to strike links in the enemys communications chain. </p><p>At the tactical level, SMS 2013 describes using worms, trojans, and logic bombs, overtaxing or altering enemy information resources and networks, and transmitting false information to enemy networks. To the latter point, <em>Science of Campaigns</em> discusses altering command and control instructions, causing deviations in positioning and navigation systems, and targeting weapons systems directly. SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 identifies the main shape of network attack as the use of viruses to paralyze enemy systems, steal data, tamper with an enemys information materials, disrupt networks, and implant fake intelligence. These latest textbooks also reference chip weapons (), though the meaning is not clear. Other sources like the aforementioned defense-oriented paper by authors affiliated with the AMS Warfare Research Institute and PLA Unit 31003 acknowledge more specific attack methods and typologies such as the use of malicious procedures and scripts (for example, ShellCode), authentication attacks, defense system vulnerabilities in defense systems (such as firewalls and UTM services), software, protocols, and operations, protocol flooding, DDoS, and DNS DDoS.</p><p>Although focus is placed on degrading or destroying information systems, various sources also discuss the role of cyber capabilities in manipulating perception, highlighting the relationship between cyber operations and the psychological and cognitive aspects of information warfare. For example, <em>Science of Campaigns</em> identifies special technical warfare as including actions to insert manufactured broadcasts and images in the enemys radio and television stations. In 2016, an AMS-affiliated author likewise argued that examples of network <em>weishe</em> include actions to penetrate the enemys communications networks, distribute propaganda via text messages to citizens, and broadcast propaganda via prime-time television. SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 also raise the example of how, prior to the 2003 Iraq War, thousands of Iraqi military and government personnel received emails from the US military urging surrender. The link between cyber operations and psychological impact is further highlighted in discussions of target selection.</p><p><strong>Attack Targets</strong> <br />According to SMS 2017 and SMS 2020, network-electromagnetic warfare mainly targets the opposite sides psychology, cognitive domain, and decision-making systems as well as vital and politically sensitive information infrastructure. The objective is to cause a change in the decisions and actions of enemy leaders, thereby changing the overall situation of the conflict. Specific targets these textbooks name include ground, air, and space-based infrastructure network equipment as well as enemy armed forces, equipment systems, mobilization response mechanisms, and overall support systems. Other targets mentioned include strategic warning systems and military information systems.</p><p>The focus is not solely on the adversarys military targets, but extends to civilian critical infrastructure. SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 assert that major targets of network warfare also include national decision-makers, as well as the information systems of energy, transportation, and other national information infrastructure. Without necessarily advocating this as an intentional approach to cyber operations, SMS 2017 and SMS 2020 further observe that network attacks can damage or cause the collapse of an economy, cause political, economic, and social chaos, and even shake [the enemys] will to war.</p><p>Other sources are more explicit in proposals to target some forms of critical infrastructure. The aforementioned 2016 article by an author affiliated with AMS suggests causing short-period large-scale blackouts in important enemy cities as a form of network <em>weishe</em>. Further, the procurement activities of Chinese government entities and state-owned enterprises, as well as research by analysts affiliated with the PLA and other organizations, demonstrate at least a defensive interest in Russias 2015 cyberattack against Ukraines power grid and follow-on attacks. Some of Chinas cyber ranges with links to defense contractors and PLA academic institutions simulate industrial control systems as well.</p><p>If Chinas network forces were able to successfully apply their capabilities in a Taiwan wartime context as described by the sources discussed above, the islands telecommunications would very likely be degraded, transportation and energy networks (including the power grid) disrupted, government and military communications networks highly impaired or manipulated with false information, and citizens and warfighters subject to demoralizing propaganda regarding the conflict.</p><p><strong>Incidents of Attack</strong> <br />Compared with real-world instances of reconnaissance and espionage, there are fewer concrete examples for Chinas destructive cyber capability. This is not evidence that China lacks the requisite abilities, but that, as of this writing, authorities have chosen not to use them. That said, Chinas network forces have indeed targeted an adversarys critical infrastructure on multiple occasions. Several such incidents, including one in Taiwan, are outlined below:</p><ul><li>During the mid-2020 border skirmishes between China and India, RedEcho targeted at least 4 Regional Load Despatch Centres and 2 State Load Despatch Centres in India, which are major elements of Indias electrical grids. They also targeted a high-voltage transmission substation and a coal-fired thermal power plant. This activity was likely a form of pre-positioning to support a potential future attack against this critical infrastructure or signal Chinas capability.</li><li>Taiwans state-owned energy company CPC Corporation was targeted in a mid-2020 ransomware attack by individuals named in the aforementioned 2020 US DoJ indictment of APT41 that suggests loose links to the MSS. The attack followed President Tsai Ing-wens victory in Taiwans 2020 presidential elections. Although ransomware attacks are typically financially motivated, there is some evidence that no demand for payment was made and that the attack was intended to be destructive. The attack encrypted and deleted company files and, as a result, impaired customers payment options at CPC fuel pumps.  We note that cyber threat actors likely connected to Russia and Iran have also reportedly used destructive malware posing as ransomware.</li><li>In late 2011 and late 2012, various unspecified China-linked threat actors and APT1, which is reportedly PLA Unit 61398 of the former General Staff Department Third Department, successfully breached 13 American natural gas pipeline operators and stole information related to a pipeline management system, likely in support of developing capabilities to physically damage pipelines or disrupt pipeline operations.</li></ul><p>At the lower end of the coercive spectrum, Chinas confrontations with both Taiwan and South Korea over issues of political and geostrategic concern have been marked by a similar pattern of cyber attacks from China-based threat actors to deface and degrade the functioning of foreign government and non-governmental organizations. With regard to Taiwan, Chinas response to Nancy Pelosis August 2022 visit was accompanied by a wave of DDoS and defacement attacks against government and public venues as discussed above. This is highly similar to events following South Koreas decision to accept a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery from the US in 2017. The South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs experienced a surge of DDoS and other cyberattacks and hacking attempts in the period before and after the decision.

Peacetime Chinese cyber threat activity targeting Taiwan will very likely include coercive efforts intended to prevent perceived moves toward Taiwanese independence; wartime Chinese cyber threat activity will almost certainly include cyber warfare efforts intended to seize information dominance as part of broader joint landing or blockade campaigns against Taiwan. Regarding network reconnaissance, cybersecurity and military planners should prepare for Chinese network reconnaissance operations that use network scanning, phishing, domain spoofing, zero-days, and other tools in an effort to gather intelligence and prepare for future network attacks. Regarding network attacks, planners should prepare for threats that aim to disrupt, damage, or destroy the functions of military and civilian information systems as well as critical infrastructure. As part of their preparations, cybersecurity and military planners should monitor Chinas whole-of-nation efforts to develop the network forces and weapons, as these efforts will affect the characteristics and effectiveness of Chinese network reconnaissance and attacks.</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Attack Surface Intelligence November Product Updates: New Dashboard", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Attack Surface Intelligence November Product Updates: New Dashboard"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/attack-surface-intelligence-new-dashboard"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1122_Blog_ASI_Dashboard_Main_Feature_ab40cfe887.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/attack-surface-intelligence-new-dashboard", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/attack-surface-intelligence-new-dashboard", "guidislink": false, "published": "Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 11, 22, 0, 0, 0, 1, 326, 0], "summary": "Learn about the latest Attack Surface Intelligence product updates from November 2022.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Learn about the latest Attack Surface Intelligence product updates from November 2022."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<p>In addition to the many recent <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/attack-surface-intelligence\">Attack Surface Intelligence</a> <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/october-2022-product-updates\">updates</a> that have been rolled out, another one is coming to you straight from the oven: our complete dashboard redesign.

To read the entire analysis, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2022-1122.pdf\">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</em></p><p><em>This report details the risks the holiday season presents for individuals and financial institutions, describes the tools and services that scammers can use during the holidays, and provides tips on how to avoid threats during this period. It is intended for fraud and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) teams at financial institutions and security researchers.</em></p><h2 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h2><p>With Black Friday and Cyber Monday soon beginning the holiday shopping season, merchants are increasing efforts to attract consumers and online shoppers are looking for discounts. Meanwhile, in the criminal underground, a parallel process is beginning as threat actors anticipate increased opportunities to commit fraud. While retailers offer discounts on the latest electronics and clothing, carding shops offer discounts on compromised payment card data. While manufacturers increase production and create innovative goods and services, threat actors release phishing and scam sites to lure in online shoppers and use the latest criminal software. And while retailers launch advertising campaigns and partner with marketing firms, threat actors prepare spam lists and partner with other threat actors to place online ads for their fraudulent websites.</p><p>This report analyzes threat actors offerings and discussions on fraud-focused forums, carding-shop activity, and phishing and scam website activity from previous holiday seasons. Threat activity during this period involves all stages of the fraud life cycle, from the point of compromise to sale and fraudulent monetization. Historical data from the past 3 years shows that the volume of compromised payment cards offered for sale increases during the holiday season in comparison to the preceding and following 3-month periods. Ultimately, it is likely that the 2022 holiday season will follow a similar pattern, resulting in a period of heightened risk for cardholders, financial institutions, and associated service providers.</p><h2 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h2><ul><li>Cybercriminals are sensitive to changes in victims purchasing habits during the holidays. As online shopping increases during the holidays, cybercriminals prepare to take advantage of expanded opportunities to defraud their victims.</li><li>Cybercriminals exploit seasonal changes in merchants anti-fraud measures, especially as anti-fraud measures are loosened to better handle the surge of transactions during the holidays.</li><li>Promotions, discounts, and special offers for illicit services and stolen data increase during the holidays, encouraging more cybercriminal activity both during and after the holiday season.</li><li>Cybercriminals are likely to take advantage of common holiday-related promotions such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday by creating themed phishing and scam pages designed to entice victims with the promise of savings.</li><li>An increase in compromised payment cards posted for sale is likely during the holidays. This could be a result of increased shopping activity, relaxed anti-fraud measures, and increased phishing and scam activity.</li></ul><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><p>Payment fraud is a game of cat and mouse. The cats (financial institutions, payment card networks, merchants, payment processors, law enforcement, and payment fraud intelligence companies) continue to refine data-driven anti-fraud systems, develop more secure methods of payment, and improve payment card data storage standards. For the mice (threat actors and carding shops), the focus is adaptability. They must identify the cats blind spots and squeeze out criminal profits for as long as they remain.</p><p>For threat actors, adaptability occurs at all stages of the fraud life cycle: the abuse of legitimate services for <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-actors-continue-to-abuse-google-tag-manager-for-payment-card-e-skimming\">more persistent e-skimming</a> and <a href=\"https://geminiadvisory.io/donation-sites-abuse/\">hard-to-detect card checking</a>, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2022-0726.pdf\">bypassing security advancements</a> like 3-D Secure (3DS), and responding to exogenous shocks to card fraud market like the brief but unexpected <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-and-sanctions-portend-rise-in-card-fraud\">Russian law enforcement crackdown on cybercrime. </a></p><p>Threat actors view Black Friday and the holiday season as another opportunity to adapt their schemes, offerings, and activities to squeeze out additional criminal profits. Over the past 3 years, the volume of compromised card-not-present (CNP) payment cards offered for sale on carding shops during the holiday season  November through January  has typically exceeded the preceding 3 months by an average of 5% and the following 3 months by an average of 20%. </p><p>Although the past 3 years of data indicate a relationship between the holiday season and payment fraud, we identify spikes in card fraud throughout the year resulting from a host of other factors (innovations by threat actors, large-scale breaches, carding shop dynamics, and more). Therefore, the holiday season should not be interpreted as a fundamentally exceptional period of increased fraud activity, but as another prominent example of threat actors adaptability, which in this case corresponds to a specific seasonal period. </p><h2 id=\"threat-analysis\">Threat Analysis</h2><p>Cybercriminals take advantage of the holidays to conduct their activities more frequently and effectively. The holidays present threat actors with enhanced opportunities to avoid detection since victims are less likely to notice fraudulent transactions due to the increased volume of sales and purchases. In part, promotional discounts on illicit services and stolen data within the threat actor community also facilitate a rise in attacks. Additionally, threat actors can attempt to directly exploit consumers relaxed spending habits with targeted phishing attempts such as holiday-themed phishing and scam pages.</p><p><em>Editors Note: This post is an excerpt of a full report.

This report will be of most relevance to companies, governments, and militaries with an interest in trans-regional Iranian influence operations and the broader threat landscape of influence operations in Latin America, as well as journalists and analysts following the Saab trial, which has recently been postponed.</p><h4 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h4><p>Iran and Venezuela are very likely conducting an ongoing multiyear, multifaceted influence campaign surrounding the United Statess (US) extradition and imprisonment of Alex Saab, alleged financier and special agent to Iran for the Nicols Maduro regime. Since 2019, Iranian and Venezuelan entities have sought to increase anti-American sentiment in Latin America through disinformation that claims the US is unjustly sanctioning, kidnapping, and illegally detaining Saab. We have identified the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of entities involved in the influence campaign, including official state-sponsored media outlets, social media influencers, proxies, surrogates, and political activists. We categorized the influence campaign into 4 distinct phases based on operational capabilities. Each phase represents asynchronous influence operations which, when combined, constitute the overarching Saab influence campaign:</p><ul><li><strong>PHASE I:</strong> Alex Saab disinformation narrative initiation via social media surrogates in West Africa</li><li><strong>PHASE II:</strong> Nation-state amplification of the Saab disinformation narrative through Venezuelan and Iranian state-affiliated media organizations</li><li><strong>PHASE III:</strong> Saab disinformation narrative propagation via Iranian and Venezuelan proxies, surrogates, and third-party political activists</li><li><strong>PHASE IV:</strong> Expansion of Iranian and Venezuelan influence efforts beyond the Saab influence campaign</li></ul><p>This campaign, which continues at the time of writing, highlights Iran and Venezuelas multiyear development of a robust influence network that will likely be leveraged in order to advance future nation-state priorities. </p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>Venezuela is very likely conducting an influence campaign to assert socio-political pressure on US presidential administrations to negotiate with the Nicols Maduro regime regarding the release of Alex Saab from US custody. </li><li>Iran, which has benefited from Saabs alleged activities to circumvent US sanctions, is likely using the campaign to amplify its anti-US narrative to Latin American target audiences.</li><li>Irans state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) company is very likely using its Latin American-facing news agency, HispanTV, to amplify content promoting mis- and disinformation in support of anti-US narratives.</li><li>Iran and Venezuela will very likely continue to use surrogate media organizations such as Fuser News and the Free Alex Saab Foundation to provide obfuscation and plausible deniability of state-sponsored anti-US influence operations. </li><li>We assess that Iran and Venezuela will very likely layer physical influence actions, such as government-sponsored demonstrations, with digital actions such as recorded interviews, videos, social media engagements, and news stories in order to reinforce disinformation narratives in the lead-up to Saabs trial. </li><li>The Alex Saab disinformation narrative will also likely be used as a nexus to perpetuate generalized anti-US messaging to Latin American target audiences.</li></ul><h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4><p>On July 25, 2019, The US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm778\">designated</a> Alex Nain Saab Moran (Alex Saab) for involvement in a large-scale network of corruption to obtain valuable business contracts with the Government of Venezuela. According to the designation, Saab faces US charges of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/venezuela-insider-seeks-dismissal-criminal-charges-91694723#:~:text=The%2050%2Dyear%2Dold%20Saab,to%2020%20years%20in%20prison\">money laundering</a> through a Venezuelan government food subsidy program called the Local Committees for Supply and Production, along with a global network of front and shell companies. Saab, an alleged <a href=\"https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/alex-saab-hezbollahs-money-man-in-latin-america-arrested-in-cape-verde-1.72040582\">conduit</a> of Hezbollah operations extending into Latin America, is a Colombian and Venezuelan businessman who has been <a href=\"https://www.elespectador.com/judicial/fiscalia-le-imputo-cargos-a-alex-saab-senalado-contratista-del-chavismo-article-859898\">wanted</a> by Colombian law enforcement since September 2018 and has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-maduro-ally-saab-served-confidential-dea-source-court-filing-2022-02-16\">served</a> as a law enforcement source for the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Following Saabs OFAC designation, he was appointed by Maduro as special envoy to Iran in April 2020, likely in an attempt to enable Saab to qualify for diplomatic immunity. As the US <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/trump-administration-increases-pressure-on-maduro-regime-with-new-sanctions.html\">increased</a> economic sanctions against Iran and Venezuela in early 2020, Saab allegedly <a href=\"https://www.bqprime.com/global-economics/maduro-said-to-tap-sanctioned-dealmaker-to-ship-gold-to-iran\">facilitated</a> a deal with Iran for Venezuela to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-30/iran-is-hauling-gold-bars-out-of-venezuela-s-almost-empty-vaults\">purchase</a> gasoline additives, parts, and technicians from Iran in exchange for Venezuelan gold. The gold, worth an estimated $500 million, was reportedly delivered to Iran on aircraft owned by OFAC-designated Mahan Air, which historically has transported IRGC-QF [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force] operatives, weapons, equipment, and funds abroad in support of the terrorist groups regional operations, and has also moved weapons and personnel for Hezbollah. This deal resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_whats-behind-irans-fuel-shipment-venezuela/6190247.html\">delivery</a> of 1.53 million barrels of Iranian gasoline and petrochemical components to the Maduro regime in May 2020, with both countries circumventing US sanctions. Saab remained a key facilitator to Iran on behalf of the Maduro regime until apprehended by US officials while traveling from Venezuela to Iran on June 12, 2020 on the Cape Verde island of Sal. Saab was extradited to the US on October 16, 2021, and currently faces federal charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering. </p><p>Following the US detention of Saab in June 2020, a coordinated trans-regional influence campaign began using mis- and disinformation narratives to assert socio-political pressure on Nigerian and Cape Verde government officials to release Saab prior to US extradition. Following the extradition of Saab to the US in late 2021, the influence campaign began projecting mis- and disinformation narratives surrounding Saab through a variety of influence operation TTPs using state-sponsored media outlets, social media influencers, proxies, surrogates, and political activists. The influence campaign remains active at the time of writing, leading into Saabs trial which has recently been <a href=\"https://time.news/without-a-trial-date-and-with-speculation-of-an-exchange-with-venezuela-alex-saab-is-serving-a-year-in-prison-in-the-united-states\">postponed</a>.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_1_21e0cbd45d.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1: Timeline overview of significant events surrounding the indictment, arrest, extradition, and pending trial of Alex Saab (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><h4 id=\"analysis-of-events-in-the-influence-campaign\">Analysis of Events in the Influence Campaign</h4><p>We used the Recorded Future <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/white-papers/diamond-model-influence-operations-analysis.pdf\">Diamond Model for Influence Operations</a> framework to analyze various types of influence operations, including but not limited to disinformation, fake news, propaganda, and political interference. We also used the <a href=\"https://disarmframework.herokuapp.com\">DISARM framework</a>, formerly known as the AMITT framework, throughout the report to describe and understand influence operations. We identified 4 distinct phases of influence operations supporting the Alex Saab influence campaign. The following sections detail each of these campaign phases, including specific narratives, influencers, audiences, infrastructure, and capabilities from Saab's detention in June 2020 to August 2022.</p><h5 id=\"phase-i-narrative-initiation-via-social-media-surrogates\">PHASE I: Narrative Initiation via Social Media Surrogates</h5><p>We assess that the first phase of the Alex Saab influence campaign likely originated in West Africa through a private public relations firm, a private digital marketing company, a nonprofit organization, and multiple social media influencers in January 2021. The geographic region and timing of the surge in social media mentions correspond to Saabs physical location in Cape Verde, Africa. We assess coordination likely took place between individuals affiliated with the Venezuelan government and the private companies identified below. Coordination efforts very likely focused on causing Venezuelan target audiences (government officials, citizens, and the general public) to engage with West African target audiences (Nigerian and Cape Verdean government officials, Nigerian and Ghanaian citizens, and the general public) on social media. The mechanism used to cause this interaction was almost certainly having West African social media influencers tag Venezuelan government officials on their social media posts. This influence conduit was very likely created to apply socio-political pressure on the Nigerian and Cape Verdean governments to release Alex Saab before his extradition back to the US.</p><h6 id=\"nigerian-influence-network-and-social-media-surrogates\">Nigerian Influence Network and Social Media Surrogates</h6><p>Following the US detainment of Alex Saab, a social media influence operation was likely <a href=\"https://guardian.ng/news/twitter-allegedly-suspends-nigerian-accounts-for-supporting-alex-saab\">initiated</a> in January 2021 by employees of a Nigerian public relations firm, Alpha Reach, and UK-based nonprofit Digital Good Governance for Africa (DIGA). The operation began with the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/nigerian-twitter-campaign-alex-saab\">recruitment</a> of social media influencers/surrogates in Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal. These social media influencers/surrogates received a Saab campaign briefing document produced on the letterhead of Digital Good Governance for Africa asking them to produce social media posts in support of Saab, almost certainly in order to increase negative public opinion surrounding court proceedings in Nigeria and Cape Verde, the African island nation where Saab remained under house arrest awaiting extradition to the US. </p><p>Alpha Reach <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac40d3bc-e742-417c-9cbb-cf1a1d849c93\">recruited</a> an estimated 40 Nigerian influencers to participate in the influence operation; the influencers had a total of more than 1 million social media followers. Each influencer was added to a WhatsApp group to coordinate and synchronize social media posts and was paid approximately $6.50 to $15, presumably per post. Participants were expected to post twice a week using <em>#FreeAlexSaab</em> and tag prominent social media accounts including Venezuelan government officials as well as Nigerian, Ghanaian, and Senegalese government and business platforms, celebrities, and activists. From January to February 2021, over 1,500 social media accounts that posted the <em>#FreeAlexSaab</em> hashtag were disabled due to inauthentic behavior.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_2_f163aa6a8c.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 2: A screenshot of a social media post from a likely Nigerian influence operation participant challenging the Cape Verde government, using the <em>#FreeAlexSaab</em> hashtag, and tagging Venezuelan government officials (Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Thilyconcept/status/1372250221489614854\">Social Media</a>)</strong></p><h6 id=\"astroturfing-in-ghana\">Astroturfing in Ghana</h6><p>Throughout June 2021, PromoCoreGH, a digital marketing company that reportedly <a href=\"https://elpitazo.net/internacional/cazadores-de-fake-news-empresa-de-marketing-dirige-campana-pro-alex-saab-en-ghana\">provided</a> public positioning services on social networks, published a social media post advertising their services. The social media post showed the social media influencers the company used to promote digital media campaigns contracted by third parties. PromoCoreGH, assessed to formerly be located in Accra, Ghana, utilized over 50 social media influencers to generate what would appear as naturally developed online social movements, but were actually fabricated posts in support of a clients influence campaign (an influence technique known as astroturfing). Several of the identified influencers actively supported the Alex Saab disinformation narrative, alleging that Saab was illegally detained and posting hashtags such as <em>#LetAlexGo</em>, <em>#ReleaseAlex</em>, <em>#TheProxyPolicy</em>, <em>#FreedomToBeHeard</em>, and <em>#IllegalHouseArrest</em> as well as memes and videos rallying for Saabs release from Cape Verde custody.

Following news coverage of the concert and the appearance of the graffiti, mainstream news outlets began publishing articles on Alex Saab.

The following day, Venezuelas teleSUR published a disinformation article titled Venezuelan Diplomat Alex Saab Is a Prisoner of War, Iran Says. On October 16, 2021, Alex Saab was extradited to the US, which attracted international news attention and amplified disinformation surrounding Saab across Iranian and Venezuelan state-owned and sponsored media outlets, proxy and surrogate media affiliates, and social media influencers.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_table_2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_table_2_b948ecd565.png\" /></p><p><strong>Table 2: Recorded Future Diamond Model for Influence Operations: PHASE II, Nation State Amplification of the Narrative</strong></p><h5 id=\"phase-iii-narrative-propagation-via-proxies-surrogates-and-political-activists\">PHASE III: Narrative Propagation via Proxies, Surrogates, and Political Activists</h5><p>Throughout the duration of the Saab influence campaign from approximately November 2021 to present, we have identified specific groups and individuals with varying degrees of connection to state-sponsored media organizations that are likely central participants in the dissemination of mis- and disinformation surrounding Saab.

We identified at least 2 proxy organizations actively participating in the Alex Saab disinformation campaign: HispanTV (Iran) and teleSUR (Venezuela).</p><p><strong>HispanTV</strong><br />Iranian proxy media organization HispanTV is a subsidiary of Irans state-owned IRIB. HispanTV provides a platform for IRIB content to reach Central and South American target audiences and has used the name Nexo Latino (Latin Nexus) on social media platforms. Pablo Jofre Leal has been <a href=\"https://www.telesurtv.net/staff/pleal\">identified</a> as a contributing journalist for HispanTV covering Saab. Leal also writes for the other proxy identified, teleSUR, and he participated in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53Hc4Pri-Vk&amp;list=PLwRw90q01R2L69dXDddPcFlEtRfPhlYPF&amp;index=2&amp;ab_channel=FuserNews\">Free Alex Saab Foundation Webinar</a>, which is analyzed further below. Bashar Barazi, who has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrsNobody1407/status/1553325800149090306\">spoken</a> out against US detainment of Saab and appeared on the Free Alex Saab Movements social media in July 2022, also writes for HispanTV. Barazi was formerly an editor for the Syrian state-sponsored Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) and his writing has previously been published by pro-Hezbollah outlet Al Mayadeen.</p><p><strong>teleSUR</strong><br />Approved under Hugo Chvez, teleSUR was founded in 2005, at which time the head of Venezuela's Ministry of Communication and Information <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081123043258/http://www.minci.gov.ve/noticias-prensa-presidencial/28/7256/aprobada_creacion_de.html\">discussed</a> its purpose as a tool for information integration efforts within the region.

The company is headquartered in Caracas, Venezuela, and provides terrestrial and satellite news services as well as a news website and multiple social media platforms. Following Saabs detainment in Cape Verde, teleSUR has produced and broadcasted disinformation on telesurtv[.]net as well as on associated social media platforms alleging that Saab was kidnapped by the US. Pabro Jofre Leal is recognized by teleSUR as a contributing author, with approximately 10 teleSUR stories published about Saab in the past year.</p><h6 id=\"surrogates-segundopaso-the-free-alex-saab-foundation-fuser-news-venezuela-news-and-al-mayadeen\">Surrogates: SegundoPaso, The Free Alex Saab Foundation, Fuser News, Venezuela News, and Al Mayadeen</h6><p>The nation-state and proxy media organizations previously mentioned are likely using the following surrogate organizations to produce, share, and amplify mis- and disinformation surrounding Saab to obfuscate and maintain plausible deniability of state-sponsored anti-US influence operations. Recorded Future analysts, in the context of influence operations, use the term surrogate to refer to a non-nation-state entity that performs specific functions to assist in the accomplishment of the nation-states objectives. Surrogates provide capabilities that the nation-state does not have, or does not desire to employ, while remaining non-attributable to the nation-state.</p><p><strong>SegundoPaso</strong><br />Irans Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) states: SegundoPaso produces content on a wide variety of social, political, cultural, health and religious topics, according to the needs of the Latin American peoples. SegundoPaso publishes anti-US content, including an ongoing podcast produced by Dr. Angel Rafael Tortolero, senior research professor at Venezuelas Universidad Nacional Experimental Rmulo Gallegos (UNERG), who actively <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KfBran/status/1557432330310094848\">contributes</a> disinformation to the Alex Saab influence campaign. SegundoPaso is likely being used by Iran as a platform to project anti-US sentiment to target audiences located in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. We identified Pablo Jofre Leal as a SegundoPaso contributing author.</p><p><strong>The Free Alex Saab Foundation</strong><br />The Free Alex Saab Foundation, also identified as The Free Alex Saab Movement, has organized events, maintains a website, and engages on multiple social media accounts including YouTube. The Recorded Future Platform indicates that the certificate for the domain freealexsaab[.]org was registered November 30, 2021, which is also likely the organizations approximate founding date.</p><p>As a central entity in the Saab influence campaign, the Free Alex Saab Foundation continues to actively disseminate information in support of the principle disinformation narrative alleging the US is unjustly sanctioning, kidnapping, and illegally detaining Saab. This past year, the Free Alex Saab Foundation coordinated a <em>#FreeAlexSaab</em> Webinar held on February 10, 2022, in which HispanTV journalist Pablo Jofre Leal was a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53Hc4Pri-Vk&amp;list=PLwRw90q01R2L69dXDddPcFlEtRfPhlYPF&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=FuserNews\">participant</a>. The Free Alex Saab Movement also coordinated a conference held at the Bolivarian University of Venezuela (February 14, 2022), arranged an event in Caracas with Saabs wife Camilla Fabri (March 24, 2022), attended the Workers Summit of the Americas in Mexico (June 10, 2022), and participated in protests against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Spain (June 27, 2022). A video of HispanTVs Bashar Barazi appeared on the Free Alex Saab Movements social media on July 29, 2022. During the video, Barazi amplifies the disinformation narrative, claiming the US is illegally detaining Saab and requesting automatic release.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_9.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_9_1edabbadf6.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 9: Screenshot of the Free Alex Saab Movement social media post featuring HispanTV journalist Bashar Barazi (Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeAlexSaabOrg/status/1553049981635928065\">Social Media</a>)</strong></p><p><strong>Fuser News</strong><br />We assess that Fuser News is likely a surrogate media organization for the Venezuelan government. The Recorded Future Platform indicates the Fuser News domain (fusernews[.]com) was registered on September 9, 2021, during the ongoing Saab influence campaign. Multiple links to Fuser News articles are <a href=\"https://freealexsaab.org/en/la-consigna-free-alex-saab-retumbo-en-madrid-durante-la-cumbre-por-la-paz-otan-no\">embedded</a> within the Free Alex Saab Foundation website, and identical disinformation media content focused on the alleged US kidnapping of Saab appears on both Fuser News and freealexsaab[.]org. Fuser News has directly supported the distribution of Free Alex Saab Foundation content such as the <em>#FreeAlexSaab</em> Webinar mentioned above. Anbal Garzn, a social media influencer and self-identified sociologist, communicator, and anti-imperialist, reported the suspension of both the Fuser News and Venezuela News social media accounts on July 29, 2022. At the time of writing this report, both the <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/fusernews_\">Fuser News</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Agencia_VN\">Venezuela News</a> social media accounts remain offline; however, similar social media accounts titled <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/fuser_news_es\">Fuser News Agencia</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AgenciaVN_\">Agencia Venezuela News</a> (further analyzed below) remain active. The Fuser News Agencia account was activated in August 2022. Garzn has been a participant in events covered by Fuser News, such as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53Hc4Pri-Vk&amp;list=PLwRw90q01R2L69dXDddPcFlEtRfPhlYPF&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=FuserNews\">#FreeAlexSaab Webinar</a> with Pablo Jofre Leal on February 10, 2022.

The Recorded Future Platform indicates the Fuser News domain (venezuela-news[.]com) was registered on May 31, 2021, 4 months prior to the registration of fusernews[.]com, coinciding with the ongoing Saab influence campaign. Venezuela News continues to publish disinformation alleging the US kidnapped Saab, on venezuela-news[.]com as well as on associated social media accounts on multiple platforms including Agencia Venezuela News as mentioned above. On September 16, 2022, venezuela-news[.]com published an article and social media videos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad7pWmNhG8k\">promoting</a> the premiere of a documentary film titled Alex Saab: A Kidnapped Diplomat, which was aired on the Venezuelan State Television (VTV) channel and teleSUR, and was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhO3k-sazdM\">uploaded</a> to YouTube by the Alliance for Global Justice (analyzed further below) on September 16, 2022.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_12.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_12_2209c8089b.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 12: Screenshot of venezuela-news[.]com article promoting the premiere of the Alex Saab documentary on September 16, 2022 (Source: venezuela-news[.]com)</strong></p><p><strong>Al Mayadeen</strong><br />Al Mayadeen, a pro-Hezbollah media outlet located in Lebanon, is very likely a surrogate media organization for the government of Iran. Articles authored by Pablo Jofre Leal and by Bashar Barazi have been published on Al Mayadeens Latin American-facing website. Al Mayadeen continues to publish disinformation surrounding the Saab trial, including claims that the US is using torture methods against Saab and that former US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper knew Saab was a diplomat. Current US court filings by the DEA refute this, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/2/16/maduro-ally-saab-was-dea-informant-before-arrest-records-show\">stating</a> that Saab was an active law enforcement source and that his failure to surrender to US authorities resulted in the current charges.</p><p><strong>Political Activists</strong><br />We identified 3 political advocacy groups that very likely contribute to, and are reinforced by, the Saab influence campaign through the amplification of misinformation: the Alliance for Global Justice, Code Pink, and Spains United Left. These organizations and websites are unlikely to be deliberately organized elements within the Saab influence campaign. However, through shared political ideology, these political activist groups provide a mechanism of convenience for the Saab campaign to amplify corresponding misinformation in order to complement the overarching disinformation narrative, using the pre-existing communications infrastructure of each respective organization.</p><p><strong>Alliance for Global Justice</strong><br />The Alliance for Global Justice (AFGJ) is a 501(c)(3) organization that describes itself as anti-capitalist and favoring a multipolar world order, which <a href=\"https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/alliance-for-global-justice\">reportedly</a> arose from the Nicaragua Network, an organization that supported the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Nicaragua. The Alliance for Global Justice website (afgj[.]org) maintains a web page titled Join the Campaign to Free Alex Saab, which contains an extensive compilation of multimedia surrounding Saab including links to multiple articles from various sources including teleSUR and freealexsaab[.]org. The Alliance for Global Justice website also features links to a corresponding YouTube channel that features the Alex Saab documentary film; as advertised in the video, the film was likely developed by the private marketing firm El Bunker located in Caracas, Venezuela.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_13.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_13_1238484924.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 13: Screenshot of the Alex Saab documentary film released on September 16, 2022 (Source: afgj[.]org)</strong></p><p><strong>Code Pink</strong><br />Code Pink is a feminist antiwar 501(c)(3) organization founded in 2002 to protest US military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. On September 15, 2021, the Code Pink movement <a href=\"https://www.codepink.org/free_alex_saab_action\">held</a> a protest in front of the Cape Verde Embassy in Boston, Massachusetts, to demand the release of Saab. Code Pink continued public demonstrations in support of Saabs release through November 2021, <a href=\"https://www.codepink.org/chicago_alexsaab\">holding</a> a small demonstration in Chicago, Illinois, and then <a href=\"https://www.codepink.org/freealexsaab\">launching</a> a petition advocating all charges be dropped against Saab in October 2021. Most recently, Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Code Pink, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/medeabenjamin/status/1570428388338180098\">posted</a> social media content about Saabs illegal arrest and imprisonment on September 15, 2022. We expect Code Pink will very likely continue to coordinate demonstrations and deliver misinformation about Saab leading into Saabs trial, which has recently been <a href=\"https://time.news/without-a-trial-date-and-with-speculation-of-an-exchange-with-venezuela-alex-saab-is-serving-a-year-in-prison-in-the-united-states\">postponed</a>.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_14.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_14_feef86a85c.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 14: Screenshots of the Code Pink <a href=\"https://www.codepink.org/freealexsaab\">petition</a>, which uses recycled graffiti imagery and amplifies Saab misinformation (Source: <a href=\"https://www.codepink.org/freealexsaab\">codepink.org</a>)</strong></p><p><strong>Spains United Left</strong><br />We also identified Spains United Left (Izquierda Unida) as a political advocacy group actively <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeAlexSaabOrg/status/1541365723150303233\">disseminating</a> Saab misinformation. Sira Rego, a <a href=\"https://izquierdaunida.org/2019/06/27/la-eurodiputada-de-unidas-podemos-sira-rego-candidata-de-la-izquierda-a-presidir-el-parlamento-europeo\">spokesperson</a> for the United Left, is quoted within an article published by the Free Alex Saab Foundation website summarizing the organization's participation in anti-NATO protests in Spain on June 27, 2022. We identified likely attempts during these protests to falsely impose the Saab narrative on the United Lefts demonstration. Content published by Fuser News included images and videos of large crowds waving United Left flags and chanting anti-NATO themes unrelated to Saab, intermixed with individual interviews discussing Alex Saab. This technique of framing an unrelated demonstration as part of the Saab influence campaign was likely an attempt to manipulate the perception of the amount of current support for Saabs release.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_15.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_15_d613dc4965.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 15: Screenshots from Fuser News YouTube video of anti-NATO protests in Spain on June 27, 2022 (left) intermingled with individual interviews about Saab (right) (Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIVY6E218nQ&amp;ab_channel=FuserNews\">YouTube</a>)</strong></p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_table_3.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_table_3_1bd01a3a3a.png\" /></p><p><strong>Table 3: Recorded Future Diamond Model for Influence Operations: PHASE III, Narrative Propagation via Proxies and Surrogates</strong></p><h5 id=\"phase-iv-expansion-of-influence-efforts-beyond-the-saab-influence-campaign\">PHASE IV: Expansion of Influence Efforts beyond the Saab Influence Campaign</h5><p>As of September 2022, we identified 4 identical disinformation articles authored by Pablo Jofre Leal and published by Al Mayadeen, SANA, hispanTV, and SegundoPaso on Washington and its destructive obsession with Venezuela. These publications demonstrate the ability of Iran and Venezuela to deliver generalized anti-US messaging unrelated to the Saab disinformation narrative through the influence infrastructure described throughout this report. Based on this development, we assess that Iran and Venezuela will almost certainly continue to leverage the Saab influence infrastructure for additional influence efforts in the months to come. In particular, we assess that these networks are likely to deliver anti-West propaganda to Central and South American target audiences using state-sponsored media, proxy media organizations, and the aforementioned surrogates. Mis- and disinformation content produced by these entities will likely be shared and amplified by Irans influence network, which spreads from Iran, through the Levant, and into Latin America, creating trans-regional echo chambers of disinformation in support of Irans geopolitical ambitions.</p><p><img alt=\"iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_16.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_and_venezuela_the_alex_saab_trans_regional_influence_campaign_figure_16_320b1ec7a1.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 16: Echo chamber example of 4 identical disinformation articles authored by Pablo Jofre Leal and published by Iranian proxies Al Mayadeen, SANA, hispanTV, and SegundoPaso</strong></p><h4 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h4><p>Senior officials within Venezuelas opposition party led by Juan Guaid have <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article263653118.html\">expressed</a> fear that Maduro has adopted a new strategy of arresting Americans to pressure US President Joe Biden to release Alex Saab. In March 2022, President Biden successfully negotiated with Maduro for the release of 2 wrongfully detained Americans from Venezuelan custody. Despite the release of these 2 Americans, 3 additional Americans have been detained by Venezuela this year, adding to 8 other Americans that the US government <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article263653118.html\">believes</a> are currently being wrongfully detained.</p><p>Iran and Venezuela will very likely continue the Saab influence campaign in hopes of pressuring the US toward a negotiation to exchange Saab, thus increasing amplification efforts through their influence networks ahead of Saabs trial, with a new date for the trial yet to be confirmed. The Saab disinformation narrative will also likely be used as a mechanism to deliver and amplify generalized anti-US messaging to Latin American target audiences. The Saab influence campaign is an example of how Iran is expanding its ideological and political influence in Latin America through narrative warfare.</p><p><em>Sources used in this report include the Recorded Future Platform as well as official government communications, social media, local and regional news sites, academic studies, and other open-source information.</em></p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Fielding Threats: Cyber, Influence, and Physical Threats to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar Report", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Fielding Threats: Cyber, Influence, and Physical Threats to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar Report"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://recordedfuture.com/fielding-cyber-influence-and-physical-threats-to-2022-fifa-world-cup-in-qatar"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fielding_cyber_influence_and_physical_threats_to_2022_fifa_world_cup_in_qatar_cover_b595fb9bcc.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://recordedfuture.com/fielding-cyber-influence-and-physical-threats-to-2022-fifa-world-cup-in-qatar", "id": "https://recordedfuture.com/fielding-cyber-influence-and-physical-threats-to-2022-fifa-world-cup-in-qatar", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 11, 17, 0, 0, 0, 3, 321, 0], "summary": "In four phases of an ongoing influence campaign, Iran and Venezuela push for the release of indicted Alex Saab and spread anti-US sentiment in Latin America.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "In four phases of an ongoing influence campaign, Iran and Venezuela push for the release of indicted Alex Saab and spread anti-US sentiment in Latin America."}, "tags": [{"term": "Research (Insikt)", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Fielding Threats: Cyber, Influence, and Physical Threats to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Fielding Threats: Cyber, Influence, and Physical Threats to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/fielding-cyber-influence-and-physical-threats-to-2022-fifa-world-cup-in-qatar"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fielding_cyber_influence_and_physical_threats_to_2022_fifa_world_cup_in_qatar_e6bb96e693.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/fielding-cyber-influence-and-physical-threats-to-2022-fifa-world-cup-in-qatar", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/fielding-cyber-influence-and-physical-threats-to-2022-fifa-world-cup-in-qatar", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 11, 17, 0, 0, 0, 3, 321, 0], "summary": "With FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 about to kick off, Insikt Group\u00ae analyzes the threat landscape: disruptions, physical threats, influence operations, fraud, espionage, and more.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "With FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 about to kick off, Insikt Group\u00ae analyzes the threat landscape: disruptions, physical threats, influence operations, fraud, espionage, and more."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<p><img alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" /></p><p><em>Editors Note: This is an excerpt of a full report.

The threats analyzed include state-sponsored cyber operations, financially motivated cyber threats, influence operations, and physical security threats. This report will be of most interest to organizations involved in the hosting, running, or sponsoring of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, as well as individuals intending to participate in or attend the tournament.</p><h4 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h4><p>Whole-spectrum threats to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar are largely determined by Qatars unique geopolitical position on a contentious global stage, with the country enjoying good relations with major powers such as the United States (US), Europe, China, and Iran.</p><p>We have not identified any imminent, planned, or ongoing state-sponsored cyber operations linked to known <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/advanced_persistent_threat\">advanced persistent threat (APT)</a> groups targeting the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar or its organizers, sponsors, or associated infrastructure. China, Iran, and North Korea are unlikely to conduct a disruptive attack against the tournament as they lack motivation due to their relations with Qatar, their involvement in the planning and execution of the games, or other national priorities. Nevertheless, state-sponsored APT groups tasked with foreign intelligence collection likely view the 2022 FIFA World Cup as a target-rich environment for cyber espionage and surveillance against foreign dignitaries and businesspersons alike. </p><p>Russia is an outlier and very likely harbors a strong set of grievances and thus motivation for targeting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, such as wanting to embarrass Qatar as the host country for <a href=\"https://www.mofa.gov.qa/en/statements/qatar-stresses-necessity-of-respecting-sovereignty-territorial-integrity-of-ukraine\">siding</a> with the coalition of countries supporting Ukraines territorial integrity, as well as to retaliate for Russia being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61001565\">banned</a> from participating in the tournament. There is historical precedent for Russia conducting cyberattacks against major sporting events, although Russian APT groups are very likely distracted with Russias war against Ukraine and are therefore unlikely to conduct a disruptive attack against the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, we cannot rule out that the Russian government will encourage or otherwise tacitly approve of such attacks conducted by nationalistic Russian hacktivist groups or ransomware operators.</p><p>Large international sporting events are also attractive targets for financially motivated cybercriminals. Tournament-related phishing attacks use various lures such as so-called ticket giveaways, free streaming services to watch games, fake betting websites, and tournament-adjacent items like visas and <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252521418/Qatar-bolsters-cyber-security-in-preparation-for-World-Cup\">travel, hotel, and restaurant bookings</a>. Other cybercriminal threats include, but are not limited to: fake mobile applications around the event that can distribute malware and harvest user data; sales on dark web markets and shops for counterfeit tickets and compromised credentials; and as above, ransomware attacks that would likely seek to opportunistically target victims based on accessibility, opportunity, and factors such as the ability to pay large ransom amounts.</p><p>Iran, China, and Russias influence activities involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup are primarily being conducted through state-owned media organizations, which emphasize and promote bilateral relations with Qatar. Iran and Russia have also sought to highlight divisions and exacerbate tensions between Qatar and Western countries that have been critical of the tournament being hosted in Qatar due to human rights concerns in the country. Similarly, Irans Endless Mayfly influence operation <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign\">identified</a> by Citizen Lab in May 2019 involved an instance of disinformation around the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which sought to exacerbate geopolitical tensions between Qatar and other Arab countries following the Qatar diplomatic crisis in June 2017.</p><p>Qatar is unlikely to face a major physical security threat during the 2022 FIFA World Cup based on a range of factors including: the country having minimal terrorist incidents in recent years; the decreased capabilities of terrorist groups most likely to target the tournament, including Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP); Qatars enhanced security posture, bolstered by security assistance from countries such as the US, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Trkiye, and Pakistan; and Qatars geographical orientation.</p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>Recorded Future has not identified any imminent, planned, or ongoing state-sponsored cyber operations targeting the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Nevertheless, state-sponsored APT groups tasked with foreign intelligence collection likely view the 2022 FIFA World Cup as a target-rich environment for cyber espionage and surveillance. </li><li>Russia very likely harbors a strong set of grievances and has the greatest motivation to conduct a disruptive cyberattack against the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and there is historical precedent for Russia targeting major sporting events. However, Russian APT groups are unlikely to conduct a disruptive attack against the tournament due to their preoccupation with Russias war against Ukraine. </li><li>We cannot rule out that the Russian government will encourage or otherwise tacitly approve of disruptive attacks conducted by nationalistic Russian hacktivist groups or ransomware operators against the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Such attacks can provide plausible deniability for the Kremlin.</li><li>Cybercriminals are launching tournament-related phishing attacks using common lures such as so-called ticket giveaways to collect personally identifiable information (PII) from victims, including financial information like payment card details, or to distribute malware. </li><li>Iran and Russia have sought to highlight divisions and exacerbate tensions between Qatar and Western countries that have been critical of the tournament being hosted in Qatar. And the Iran-aligned group Endless Mayfly historically used the 2022 FIFA World Cup in an influence operation. </li><li>Qatar is unlikely to face a major physical security threat during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, although unmanned aerial systems (UAS) represent a unique disruptive threat that Qatari authorities are working to mitigate with foreign security assistance.</li></ul><h4 id=\"state-sponsored-cyber-threats\">State-Sponsored Cyber Threats</h4><p>Large international sporting events such as the Olympic Games or the World Cup are attractive targets for cybercriminals and state-sponsored APT groups alike for either financial, disruptive, or espionage purposes. Such events are often years in the making, involve the investment of billions of dollars in infrastructure to support, bring the host country considerable prestige on the international stage, and attract a wide range of spectators, including high-level government officials and businesspersons. As a result, disruption of the event can prove embarrassing for the host government and organizers, while traditional intelligence-gathering-focused cyber-espionage and surveillance activities are likely lucrative given the target-rich environment. To mitigate this risk, travelers to Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup should take additional precautions around their digital communications such as using encrypted communications applications whenever possible, exercising caution when connecting to unknown and public Wi-Fi networks (including in hotels), and considering the use of burner devices for the duration of the trip rather than personal or corporate devices. </p><p>As of this writing, we are not aware of any imminent, planned, or ongoing state-sponsored threat activity linked to known APT groups targeting the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, its organizers (such as FIFA or the Union of European Football Associations [UEFA]), its sponsors, or associated infrastructure. This includes attacks that may be disruptive or destructive in nature (such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or wiper malware) or more espionage-focused operations. Additionally, we have not observed the establishment of network infrastructure attributed to state-sponsored APT groups intended to facilitate computer network operations against the World Cup or its affiliate organizations or attendees. Similarly, we have not as of this writing found weaponized lure documents for use in spearphishing attacks. </p><p>In this section, we review the likely motivators for state-sponsored APT groups targeting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with a focus on the most prominent state-sponsored threat actors  those linked to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Overall, we assess that the Russian government is the most strongly motivated to carry out disruptive attacks against the event, but is very likely focusing its resources on supporting its war against Ukraine instead. And while Iran, China, and North Korea all likely possess the technical capabilities to do so, they are unlikely to pose a disruptive threat to the games as they lack the motivation due to their relations with Qatar, their involvement in the planning and execution of the games themselves, or other national priorities. </p><h5 id=\"china\">China</h5><p>Chinese state-sponsored APT groups are unlikely to target the World Cup and its affiliates for the purposes of disruption of the event. Nevertheless, those groups tasked with the collection of foreign intelligence, and particularly those falling under the Ministry of State Security (MSS)  Chinas primary civilian intelligence service  are likely to view the World Cup as a target-rich environment for cyber espionage and surveillance against foreign dignitaries and businesspersons alike. Likely MSS-linked cyber-espionage groups include, but are not limited to, APT10, APT17, APT27, APT40, APT41, TAG-22, RedBravo, and RedDelta.</p><p>China and Qatar have enjoyed increasingly <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202210/1277844.shtml\">close relations</a> in recent years, with Beijing and Doha announcing cooperation on a host of regional and global issues in defense, energy, and economic development, including Qatar's <a href=\"https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/opinion/30/06/2020/Qatar-and-China-natural-partners-in-Belt-and-Road-cooperation\">involvement</a> in Beijings marquee international development project, the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative\">Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)</a>. Moreover, Chinese companies maintain a considerable presence in Qatar, and the Chinese Railway Construction Corporation in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-worldcup-qatar/china-railway-construction-corp-wins-qatar-world-cup-stadium-contract-idUSKBN13N1HV\">won the bid</a> to build the largest World Cup venue, the <a href=\"https://www.seetao.com/details/129363.html\">Lusail Stadium</a>, which was completed in 2020.</p><p>Significantly, there is no historical precedent for Chinese threat activity groups targeting major international sporting events or sporting bodies, and China has shown more restraint compared to other nations in conducting wide-reaching destructive and disruptive attacks in general. Therefore, while Chinese APT groups have <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations\">regularly targeted</a> specific organizations and governments ahead of key talks, and Beijings cyber-enabled monitoring of ethnic and religious minorities domestically and internationally is <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china\">well-documented</a>, it is unlikely that China poses a disruptive threat to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This is made even more unlikely due to Chinas direct involvement in developing the infrastructure to support the event  giving it a vested interest in ensuring that it unfolds smoothly  as well as Beijings desire to continue to strengthen its relationship with Doha as a major strategic partner in the region.</p><h5 id=\"russia\">Russia</h5><p>The Russian government very likely harbors a strong set of grievances and thus motivation for targeting the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Russian activity targeting the event would likely be disruptive in nature, or otherwise seek to embarrass the international entities responsible for organizing the event such as FIFA, UEFA, or international sponsors, both public and private. </p><p>Following Russias invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, FIFA and UEFA <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/media-releases/fifa-uefa-suspend-russian-clubs-and-national-teams-from-all-competitions\">issued</a> a blanket ban against Russian football clubs from competitions, including the upcoming World Cup, in protest of the invasion. Subsequently, the Football Union of Russia abruptly <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-world-cup/story/4634624/football-union-of-russia-withdraws-appeal-over-fifa-ban\">withdrew</a> its appeal of the decision in early April, resulting in the ban remaining in place.</p><p>Russian state-sponsored APT groups have a history of targeting international sporting organizations and events beginning as early as 2016, likely in retribution for similar bans of its athletes from participation in major international events, such as the Olympic Games, due to a string of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018-russia/russia-banned-from-pyeongchang-winter-olympics-idUSKBN1DZ2QZ\">doping scandals</a>. Past Russian state-sponsored activity targeting such organizations includes:</p><ul><li>The Russian Main Intelligence Directorates (GRU) <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098\">reconnaissance</a> against the <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/russian-state-hackers-target\">2020 Tokyo Olympics</a> in an alleged effort to disrupt the event</li><li>Sandworms disruption of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics with the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack\">Olympic Destroyer</a> malware</li><li>APT28s hack-and-leak <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-rio-summer-olympics/russian-hackers-publish-more-health-data-rio-2016-olympians-n648656\">campaign</a> targeting the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180209182705/https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-09/cyber-hack-update-data-leak-concerning-41-athletes-from-13-countries-and-17\">World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)</a> and Western athletes personally identifiable and personal health information (PII and PHI) during the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics</li><li>GRU operators <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/page/file/1098481/download\">targeting</a> WiFi networks and routers at hotels used by anti-doping officials in Rio de Janeiro and Lausanne, Switzerland, deploying bespoke malware once they obtained access to a host of interest</li></ul><p>While Moscow and Doha are <a href=\"https://www.gulf-times.com/story/695901/Qatar-Russia-trade-reaches-296mn-in-2020\">engaged</a> both diplomatically and economically with one another, there are signs of significant strain in the relationship, especially since Russias invasion of Ukraine. First and foremost, Qatar has <a href=\"https://www.mofa.gov.qa/en/statements/qatar-stresses-necessity-of-respecting-sovereignty-territorial-integrity-of-ukraine\">expressed</a> its support for Ukraine and the territorial integrity of the country along its internationally recognized borders. Moreover, the US formally designated Qatar as a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-designates-qatar-major-non-nato-ally-us-2022-03-10\">major non-NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] ally</a> in March 2022  a move that is very likely interpreted as signaling Qatars long-term strategic alignment with NATO and Washington instead of with Moscow. As a result, the Kremlin likely has a particularly strong grievance against Qatar and may view the World Cup as an opportunity to embarrass Qatars government.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite having the motivation to conduct such disruptive attacks against the World Cup and Qatar, the Russian government is very likely distracted with the war in Ukraine, which has turned into a grinding conflict requiring Moscow to marshal as many of the states resources as possible in an attempt to achieve its strategic aims in the face of Ukraines staunch armed resistance. It is therefore very likely that Russian APT groups that may otherwise be tasked with disruption of an international event such as the World Cup  especially those aligned with military intelligence such as APT28 or Sandworm, based on historical activity  are instead tasked with prioritizing operations that are directly in support of the war effort in Ukraine.</p><p>While we assess it is thus unlikely that established Russian state-sponsored APT groups will conduct such disruptive operations against the World Cup, we cannot rule out that the Russian government will encourage or otherwise tacitly approve of such attacks conducted by nationalistic Russian hacktivist groups  such as KillNet or XakNet  or by ransomware operators. Such groups, whether financially or politically motivated, are useful proxy forces that can on occasion further the Russian governments strategic objectives and provide plausible deniability.</p><h5 id=\"iran\">Iran</h5><p>While Iranian state-sponsored APT groups frequently target public and private entities across the Middle East in both <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-264a\">destructive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/iran\">espionage</a>-focused campaigns, they are not known for executing hacktivist-like attacks against international sporting federations. Moreover, due to the strong trade and diplomatic ties between the 2 countries, Irans participation in the World Cup despite calls for its banning, and due to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63410577\">domestic Iranian instability</a>, it is unlikely that Iran will seek to use cyberattacks to disrupt the games as doing so provides no obvious benefit to the regime and risks upsetting a key regional partner in Qatar.</p><p>This does not rule out Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS)- or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-linked espionage activity in-country, however, likely primarily directed against high-profile foreign attendees of the game and dissidents and/or critics of the Iranian regime. Such groups, including APT34 OilRig, APT35, APT39, APT42, and MuddyWater are known to routinely carry out espionage operations against Middle Eastern and Western governments and private sector companies in support of Tehrans economic, political, and military objectives. APT35 has been reported to seek <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/collateral/en/mtrends-2018.pdf\">strategic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Charming_Kitten_2017.pdf\">tactical</a> information and has also undertaken <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1131726/download\">counterintelligence</a> operations at the behest of the IRGC, including in attacks against <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/microsoft-iranian-apt-t20-summit-munich-security-conference/160654\">international conferences</a> and related organizations such as the Munich Security Conference and Think20 Summit in Saudi Arabia. For its part, APT39 has also been reported to focus on <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/apt39-iranian-cyber-espionage-group-focused-on-personal-information.html\">counterintelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/chafer-latest-attacks-reveal-heightened-ambitions\">long-term espionage</a> activity with the goals of protecting the regime.</p><p>Iran and Qatar have an abnormally close relationship given the latters membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) regional bloc, and Doha carefully balances its alliance with the US and its economic and security ties with Tehran. These ties only strengthened during and following the 2017 Qatar <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/83771\">diplomatic crisis</a> in which Doha sought to replace its traditional trading partners  who instituted an embargo against the country  with imports from Iran and Trkiye. Qatars geographic position in the Persian Gulf, as well as its sharing of the worlds largest <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2017/6/15/qatar-iran-ties-sharing-the-worlds-largest-gas-field\">natural gas field</a> with Iran, induce the 2 to closer relations despite Iranian discomfort with Qatars hosting of the largest <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/as-trump-tries-to-end-endless-wars-americas-biggest-mideast-base-is-getting-bigger/2019/08/20/47ac5854-bab4-11e9-8e83-4e6687e99814_story.html\">US military base</a> in the region at Al Udeid. Relations between Iran and Qatar have become so cordial that Iran offered  and Qatar accepted  assistance in hosting hundreds of thousands of visitors to the World Cup on the resort island of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/12/iran-preparing-to-host-world-cup-fans-after-agreement-with-qatar\">Kish</a>, offshore of Iran, thus giving Iran an economic and political stake in the success of the games.</p><p>Finally, Iran has in recent months been rocked by domestic instability and widespread protests following the death of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/world/middleeast/iran-protests-40-days.html\">Mahsa Amini</a> while in police custody. The protests  the largest in over a decade  have turned <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-dubai-united-arab-emirates-middle-east-race-and-ethnicity-43972e30624f9aedcd62aaff6d49f67a\">violent</a>, resulting in the government issuing lockdowns of the information environment within the country and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/iran-protests-2022-internet-shutdown-whatsapp\">cutting off the internet</a> from the outside world, as well as deploying security forces authorized to use <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/05/iran-security-forces-fire-kill-protesters\">lethal force</a> to quell the unrest. In order to preserve the regime, maintaining and stabilizing the domestic situation is very likely to be the primary task of the Iranian intelligence and security services in the near term. This suggests that little resourcing would likely be devoted to externally oriented cyber operations during the World Cup, even if Iran had the requisite motivation to do so.</p><h5 id=\"north-korea\">North Korea</h5><p>North Korean state-sponsored APT groups are unlikely to conduct disruptive or destructive attacks against the upcoming 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p><p>There is very limited precedence for North Korea-linked APT groups targeting international sporting events or organizations. In the 1 instance in which this was observed  in a campaign using the fileless malware Gold Dragon <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/gold-dragon-widens-olympics-malware-attacks-gains-permanent-presence-on-victims-systems\">targeting</a> Olympics-related organizations in the period surrounding the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea  the campaign appears to have been focused on intelligence gathering, which is consistent with the majority of North Korea state-sponsored cyber campaigns against the South and likely a part of their routine operations.</p><p>Moreover, the majority of historical North Korean state-sponsored APT campaigns have been focused on <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-north-korean-military-hackers-indicted-wide-ranging-scheme-commit-cyberattacks-and\">revenue generation</a> for the regime in Pyongyang, which continues to languish under strict international sanctions that limit its access to global markets. These attacks have primarily consisted of compromises of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/27/479760450/north-korea-linked-to-81-million-bangladesh-bank-heist\">financial institutions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-239a\">ATM cash-out schemes</a>, or theft of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61036733\">cryptocurrency</a>. Apart from ransomware or other forms of extortion attacks, such as the WannaCry campaign, disruptive or destructive attacks are difficult to monetize and thus are likely of less interest and priority to the regime.</p><p>With respect to the 2022 World Cup, North Korea likely lacks the political motivation to engage in disruptive or destructive activity against the games. Pyongyang <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-middle-east-health-coronavirus-pandemic-world-cup-e9694d13f52ea8b51274f1f94fe8a5ed\">voluntarily withdrew</a> from World Cup qualifiers in May 2021 likely due to concerns over COVID-19, but unlike Russia was never formally banned from participation by the organizing bodies. Moreover, Qatar has  at least until the imposition of recent United Nations (UN) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/north-korea-un-sanctions-workers-return\">sanctions</a> that went into effect at the end of 2019  been host to thousands of North Korean migrant laborers. Many of these laborers were integral to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/07/north-koreans-working-state-sponsored-slaves-qatar\">construction</a> of the venues for the upcoming World Cup games, including the aforementioned <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/343708-qatars-north-korea-connection-is-dangerous\">Lusail Stadium</a> which was built by a Chinese firm. Overall, Qatar has proven more willing than many governments to continue some form of direct relations with North Korea, and Pyongyang is unlikely to see a benefit to damaging relations via disruptive cyberattacks against the World Cup.</p><h4 id=\"cybercriminal-threats\">Cybercriminal Threats</h4><p>As mentioned above, large international sporting events such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup are attractive targets for financially motivated cybercriminals. Cybercriminal threats to the 2022 FIFA World Cup include but are not limited to tournament-related phishing attacks, fake mobile applications around the event that can distribute malware and harvest user data, sales on dark web markets and shops for counterfeit tickets, and threats of ransomware.</p><h5 id=\"phishing-and-fraud\">Phishing and Fraud</h5><p>Cybercriminals are leveraging the 2022 FIFA World Cup as a lure in phishing attacks and in other fraudulent activities. Cybercriminals are almost certainly creating fraudulent websites related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup that can be used in phishing campaigns to collect PII from victims, including financial information like payment card details, or to distribute malware. </p><p>Between October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2022, we identified:</p><ul><li>130 registered typosquat domains of fifa[.]com, 30 of which were created in October 2022 as the 2022 FIFA World Cup draws near</li><li>143 registered domains that include the terms Qatar and 2022, some of which are impersonating the official 2022 FIFA World Cup website, qatar2022[.]qa, such as in Figure 1</li><li>889 registered domains that include the terms World and Cup </li><li>56 registered domains that either include the terms ([FIFA or Qatar] and Ticket), or (World and Cup and Ticket).</li></ul><p><img alt=\"fielding_cyber_influence-and_physical_threats_to_2022_fifa_world_cup_in_qatar_figure_1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fielding_cyber_influence_and_physical_threats_to_2022_fifa_world_cup_in_qatar_figure_1_1a78bb681a.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1: Example of a typosquat domain impersonating the legitimate qatar2022[.]qa website, with redirects to other suspicious websites (Source: qatar2022[.]pro)</strong></p><p>We identified 669 references to 2022 FIFA World Cup phishing campaigns between October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2022. These phishing attacks have targeted both organizations and individuals, though as the tournament approaches, phishing attempts are very likely to focus on targeting individuals. Phishing attacks targeting individuals relate to various components of the tournament, including: tickets to the games (typically so-called <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/la-es/2022/10/27/cuidado-enganos-aprovechan-copa-mundo-catar-2022%E2%80%9D\">ticket giveaways</a>; free streaming services for when the tournament begins; betting websites; and tournament-adjacent items like visas and <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252521418/Qatar-bolsters-cyber-security-in-preparation-for-World-Cup\">travel, hotel, and restaurant bookings</a>. In November 2021, Kaspersky <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/world-cup-phishing-scams-spotted-a-year-ahead-of-the-event\">reported</a> that they detected 11,000 phishing emails between August 15 and October 15, 2021 primarily targeting organizations by inviting bids on contracts to supply goods or services for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where recipients were asked to pay a commission to participate.</p><p>Another attack vector used by cybercriminals is creating fraudulent mobile applications that impersonate legitimate ones, such as the Hayya to Qatar 2022 mobile application created by Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/qa/app/hayya-to-qatar-2022/id1593845586\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pl.qatar&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US\">Google Play</a>). We <a href=\"https://apkcombo.com/fifa-world-cup-2022/com.worldcup.fifaworldcup2022\">identified</a> multiple mobile applications posing as the official 2022 FIFA World Cup application, with thousands of downloads. Although we have not conducted an analysis of these mobile applications, we strongly recommend that individuals only download official 2022 FIFA World Cup mobile applications such as those created by Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy and by FIFA. </p><h5 id=\"dark-web-activity\">Dark Web Activity</h5><p>We identified 277 references to the 2022 FIFA World Cup on dark web special-access forums between October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2022. We observed discussions of individuals claiming to be selling tickets to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, as well as other individuals posting in an effort to purchase tickets. We also observed an individual sharing the likely compromised login details of 2 accounts for beIN CONNECT, a state-owned global sport and entertainment network headquartered in Doha, Qatar, with the individual stating SAVE FOR WORLD CUP.</p><p><img alt=\"fielding_cyber_influence-and_physical_threats_to_2022_fifa_world_cup_in_qatar_figure_2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fielding_cyber_influence_and_physical_threats_to_2022_fifa_world_cup_in_qatar_figure_2_fd016eefc6.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 2: Example of a post on a dark web forum advertising 2022 FIFA World Cup ticket sales (Source: Recorded Future)</strong></p><p>Another notable post includes an October 4, 2022 post on Cracked Forum by xAcordx advertising a malicious .doc exploit file that is claimed to be fully undetectable (FUD) by all antivirus solutions, that can be sent via Gmail and other popular email providers, and that downloads and executes any file when ran [sic]. The file is advertised at $600 for a single full FUD build, or $2,400 for the builder allowing unlimited builds with a weekly update to maintain its FUD status. The post advertises many different lures for the document, including world cup and world cup qualifying, demonstrating that the 2022 FIFA World Cup is being used as a lure in malicious documents. The threat actor also includes in their listing a proof-of-concept video that demonstrates the exploits functionality.</p><p><img alt=\"fielding_cyber_influence-and_physical_threats_to_2022_fifa_world_cup_in_qatar_figure_3.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fielding_cyber_influence_and_physical_threats_to_2022_fifa_world_cup_in_qatar_figure_3_d03c9d4ed4.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 3: Exploit with features advertised by xAcordx (Source: Cracked Forum)</strong></p><p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/identity-intelligence\">Recorded Futures Identity Intelligence Module</a> identified credential leaks for 14 unique *@qatar2022[.]qa email addresses on both clearnet and dark web sources, including 8 unique email addresses with associated passwords.

Credential leaks can be abused by threat actors to obtain initial access into an organization or to perform additional fraudulent activities such as social engineering, spearphishing, and business email compromise (BEC). However, the passwords associated with the email addresses in the aforementioned breaches could be passwords for other websites where the owner used their qatar2022[.]qa email address for a different online service, and are not necessarily the passwords for the owners email account or corporate network. Using unique passwords for each online service mitigates the risk that leaked credentials can be used by threat actors to access more than 1 online service.</p><p>Finally, we identified 269 references to tickets[.]fifa[.]com and hayyar[.]qatar2022[.]qa on dark web shops, specifically Russian Market, Genesis Store, and 2easy Shop. These 2 domains are used to purchase tickets to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and to apply for a Hayya Card, respectively. All tournament visitors need a <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/hayya-card-en\">Hayya Card</a> to be permitted entry to Qatar, for access to match stadiums, and for free use of public transportation on match days. Visitors applying for a Hayya Card need to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2022/10/26/no-hayya-no-entry-fifa-world-cup-2022\">provide</a> their personal details. As explained below, these dark web shops sell packages of compromised account details and user logs; cybercriminal actors could purchase compromised account details from these, and other, dark web shops and marketplaces that could lead to greater theft of PII data and possibly match tickets.</p><ul><li>Russian Market is a dark web shop operated by the threat actor RussianMarket that sells dumps, RDP and SSH access, logs, and various account details. Threat actors who purchase credentials typically log in to the accounts and perform malicious activities such as BEC, privilege escalation, and overall online identity takeovers due to extensive information about the source of the credentials and cookies being scraped from victims.</li><li>Genesis Store sells packages of compromised account credentials and associated user data designed to allow threat actors to bypass anti-fraud solutions. Victim data is sold in a single package referred to as a bot, which includes account credentials, IP address, browser fingerprint (system information), and cookies. After purchasing a bot, the victim data can be imported into a browser plugin called Genesis Security, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the victim to perform attacks such as account takeovers or card-not-present fraud. The price for each bot varies depending on the amount of account credentials, types of accounts, and geographical location of the victim</li><li>2easy Shop sells stealer logs harvested from victims infected with infostealers. The prices for logs vary between $3 and $200 per listing and include compromised user logs and accounts from hundreds of organizations worldwide. When compromised data is purchased on 2easy Shop, a buyer typically receives a victims browser cookie data, browser history, screenshots, general system information about compromised machines, and other data. The compromised account credentials and associated user data are commonly used by threat actors to bypass targeted organizations defenses and anti-fraud solutions.</li></ul><h5 id=\"ransomware\">Ransomware</h5><p>We have not identified any specific threats made by ransomware groups demonstrating intent to target the 2022 FIFA World Cup, though we would not expect such conversations to appear in the open. Similar to what we described in our report on <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2022-0126.pdf\">Threats to the 2022 Winter Olympics</a>, the 2022 FIFA World Cup may be seen as an attractive target for ransomware attacks given the potential for significant profit, as organizations involved in the tournament will want to ensure the tournament goes as smoothly as possible. Potential targets could include organizations that support the 2022 FIFA World Cup, including those in the transportation, media, healthcare, logistics, and security sectors. However, it is more likely that ransomware operators would seek to opportunistically target victims based on accessibility, opportunity, and factors such as the ability to pay large ransom amounts, as opposed to conducting a large-scale coordinated attack. We have created dozens of Hunting Packages for ransomware families that can be used to detect ransomware samples and behavior.</p><p>As discussed above, as a result of Russia being banned from participating in the 2022 FIFA World Cup due to their war against Ukraine and their strained relations with Qatar, we cannot rule out that the Russian government will encourage or otherwise tacitly approve disruptive attacks conducted by nationalistic Russian hacktivist groups  such as KillNet or XakNet  or by ransomware operators. Such threat groups, whether financially or politically motivated, are useful proxy forces that can on occasion further the Russian governments strategic objectives and provide plausible deniability. We have previously documented the ties between the Russian state and Russia-based cybercriminals in our report <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-state-connections-criminal-actors\">Dark Covenant: Connections Between the Russian State and Criminal Actors</a>.</p><h4 id=\"influence-operations\">Influence Operations</h4><p>As a result of Qatars unique geopolitical position, influence operations involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup will likely attempt to win over Qatar by emphasizing and promoting bilateral relations while creating and exacerbating tensions between Qatar and the influencers adversaries. As discussed above, Qatar maintains good relations with <a href=\"https://agsiw.org/qatar-and-iran-expand-ties-amid-broader-gulf-de-escalation\">Iran</a> and <a href=\"https://beijing.embassy.qa/en/china/qatar--china-relations\">China</a>, and previously had good relations with <a href=\"https://gulfif.org/the-russo-ukrainian-war-and-the-forked-path-of-qatar-russia-relations\">Russia</a> that have since been strained as a result of Qatar siding with the coalition of countries supporting Ukraines territorial integrity. Meanwhile, Qatar enjoys good relations with the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-qatar\">US</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-communique-united-kingdom-the-state-of-qatar\">UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/qatar/228524\">Germany</a>, and many other Western countries. Qatar also <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/09/qatari-oil-gas-exports-100-2022#:~:text=Qatari%20gas%20exports%20to%20Europe,of%20Ukraine%20began%20in%20February.\">offers</a> Europe an alternative to their dependency on Russian gas exports during Russias war against Ukraine.</p><h5 id=\"positive-influence\">Positive Influence</h5><p>We have observed efforts by Iran, China, and Russia to emphasize their support for Qatar in hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup and to promote bilateral relations through state-owned media outlets. For example: </p><ul><li>Irans Mehr News Agency published an article on October 18, 2022 entitled Iran calls for boosting Tehran-Doha economic cooperation, citing the readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide any kind of assistance for holding the 2022 World Cup in Doha.</li><li>Chinas Global Times published an article on October 24, 2022 entitled China-Qatar relations exemplified in World Cup preparation, giant panda fostering, joint efforts in energy crisis: ambassador following an interview with Qatars Ambassador to China Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Dehaimi.</li><li>Russias RT published an article on October 13, 2022 citing Putins support of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, stating that Russia is doing everything we can in terms of transferring [our] experience of preparing for the World Cup, with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, responding that Russian friends have provided great support to Qatar, especially in terms of organization, with the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup  We thank you for this and we are proud of this relationship.</li></ul><h5 id=\"negative-influence\">Negative Influence</h5><p>Western countries (including <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/28/football/qatar-germany-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html#:~:text=Claudius%20Fischbach%2C%20Germany's%20ambassador%20to,Minister%20Habeck%20in%20March%202022.\">Germany</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63066393\">Denmark</a>, <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/sport/20221004-french-cities-ditch-world-cup-festivities-to-protest-qatar-s-record-on-human-rights-environment\">France</a>, and others) have been critical of Qatars hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, citing human rights concerns in the country. This criticism presents an opportunity for adversaries to highlight divisions and exacerbate tensions between Qatar and the West. We have not observed China taking advantage of this opportunity, whereas Iran and Russia have used state-owned media organizations to highlight Western criticism of Qatar. For example:</p><ul><li>Iranian state media highlighted multiple examples of Western countries criticizing Qatar due to human rights concerns, including: remarks from Germanys Interior Minister Nancy Faeser; the Netherlands House of Representatives asking the Dutch government to not send a delegation (though the Dutch government ultimately decided to send a delegation); German football player Toni Kroos stating that hes against the 2022 FIFA World Cup being hosted in Qatar; and more.</li><li>Russias RT also highlighted multiple examples of Western countries criticizing Qatar due to human rights concerns, including: multiple mens football teams protesting with their football kits ; remarks from Germanys Interior Minister Nancy Faeser; reports that some French cities will not be broadcasting the 2022 FIFA World Cup in public areas in protest against Qatar; and more.</li><li>Global Researchs French-language website, Mondialisation[.]ca, published an article on October 28, 2022 stating that Western countries have launched a campaign to criticize Qatar on LGBT issues, or the conditions of foreign workers because Qatar has not bowed to Western pressure on gas supplies to replace Russian gas.

An externally directed terrorist attack, while unlikely for reasons enumerated below, would have the greatest potential impact, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) represent a unique threat vector for targeting attendees and disrupting the event. Qatar has taken steps to mitigate this risk by bolstering its defenses and is receiving security assistance from multiple countries for the duration of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, particularly to defend against any UAS attacks. </p><h5 id=\"terror-tactics-and-uas\">Terror Tactics and UAS</h5><p>Terrorist attacks typically use unconventional methods to inflict casualties, disrupt societies, and damage economies. These tactics vary based on the environment in which the terrorists operate, but have included <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-58057162\">solo knife attacks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30708237\">coordinated small arms operations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-us-consulate-kuwait.html\">suicide bombings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730\">vehicle ramming</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/01/drones-isis/134542\">UAS</a>, including so-called suicide drones. The use of UAS represent a potentially significant evolution in terrorist operations since it utilizes commercial off-the-shelf technology readily available in many countries, which can be modified to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/08/22/ukrainian-drones-are-carpet-bombing-the-russians/?sh=2e0118a865d1\">deploy</a> explosive payloads or <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-shoots-down-unarmed-hezbollah-drones-heading-gas-rig-security-source-2022-07-02\">perform</a> target reconnaissance.

According to the US Department of State, there were no reported terrorist incidents in Qatar in <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2020/qatar\">2020</a> (the most recent year they published such data) or <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2019/qatar/#:~:text=2019%20Terrorist%20Incidents%3A%20There%20were,law%20on%20September%2011%2C%202019.\">2019</a>. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/geopolitical-intelligence\">Recorded Futures Geopolitical Intelligence Module</a> did not identify any notable references to terrorist attacks in Qatar in the last 3 years. There have also not been any recent UAS attacks against Qatar. However, the Houthis have used UAS against targets in nearby Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the past few years. For example, the Houthis <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/3/timeline-uae-drone-missile-attacks-houthis-yemen\">launched</a> UAS attacks against the UAE as recently as January and February of 2022, and have regularly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/attack-refinery-riyadh-did-not-affect-petroleum-supplies-spa-2022-03-10\">targeted</a> critical infrastructure in Saudi Arabia including oil facilities and pipelines and airports. Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIL have also <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2020/12/how-the-army-out-innovated-the-islamic-states-drones\">used</a> UAS, and the United Nationss top official on counter-terrorism, Vladimir Voronkov, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/daesh-isis-significantly-increased-drone-use-in-past-year-un-warns/2657704\">told</a> the UN Security Council in August 2022 that ISIL has also significantly increased the use of UAS in the past year, including reported [sic] in northern Iraq.</p><h5 id=\"terrorist-groups\">Terrorist Groups</h5><p>In June 2017 several Arab countries, including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, and Bahrain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/05/qatar-diplomatic-crisis-what-you-need-to-know\">broke</a> diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing Qatar of embracing various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region, including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaeda, ISIL, and groups supported by Iran in Saudi Arabias eastern province of Qatif. This rupture came after years of similar concerns expressed in the US by <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115hhrg26427/html/CHRG-115hhrg26427.htm\">Congressional members</a>, <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jl2308\">Treasury Department officials</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA13/20170726/106329/HHRG-115-FA13-Wstate-LevittM-20170726.pdf\">foreign policy experts</a>. Relations between Qatar and its fellow Gulf countries began to be restored in January 2021, and the US government has <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0381\">partnered</a> with Qatari counterparts to <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0806\">stem</a> the flow of terrorist financing on the Arabian peninsula, indicating that Doha is taking steps to address these concerns. Nevertheless, Qatars unique geopolitical position, as discussed in the Influence Operations section of this report  particularly its good relations with Iran  likely contributes to the lack of terrorist attacks that have affected Qatar.</p><p>Although an externally directed terrorist attack against the 2022 FIFA World Cup is unlikely, the event does present an opportunity for a symbolic strike against a gathering that represents global cooperation and a relationship between Western countries and Muslim-majority and Arab nations. We note that an attack on the World Cup aligns with historic targeting objectives of the following terrorist organizations and actors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>ISIL </strong> Since the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-backed-force-says-islamic-states-caliphate-destroyed-in-syria-11553322489\">collapse</a> of its caliphate under a US-led military campaign in March 2019, followed by the subsequent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/world/middleeast/al-baghdadi-dead.html\">death</a> of its founder, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIL has <a href=\"https://ctc.usma.edu/the-islamic-state-at-low-ebb-in-iraq-the-insurgent-tide-recedes-again\">endured</a> a steady decline in its operational capacity, but still likely retains the capability to <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/minister-arab-israeli-terrorists-in-hadera-shooting-affiliated-to-islamic-state\">coordinate</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/vienna-terror-attack-islamist-motive-suspected-in-deadly-shootings/a-55478882\">inspire</a> an attack on Qatari soil. Although ISIL has not conducted a large-scale external attack outside of the Levant since the 2019 Easter <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/world/asia/sri-lanka-attacks-isis.html\">bombings</a> in Sri Lanka, the 2022 FIFA World Cup would likely be a target of interest for the organization. This assessment is based on the high-profile nature of the event, which will draw numerous political delegations from major Western countries that ISIL has attacked previously, as well as threats ISIL has issued against the Qatari government for a number of perceived sins. These grievances include: hosting US and other foreign forces at Al Udeid air base; supporting the Iraqi Awakening Movement; and collaborating with the Iranian government, the IRGC, and Hezbollah (delivered in a May 2020 audio <a href=\"https://kyleorton.co.uk/2020/05/28/islamic-state-spokesman-addresses-coronavirus-expansion-in-africa-and-qatar/#more-6450\">statement</a> by the former ISIL spokesman, Abu Hamza al-Qurashi, and published in an article in a June 2020 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/azelin/status/1268733799602544641?s=20&amp;t=AyJ5SRBk9CmNIFaCWPl4hw\">edition</a> of Al-Naba). Also, an infographic in the most recent edition of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISK)s Voice of Khurasan magazine celebrated the recent death of Doha-based Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi and denounced his service to the Taghut of the at-Thanis house in Qatar  using the same derogatory term that ISK reserves for the Taliban, its primary antagonist in Afghanistan.</p></li><li><p><strong>AQAP </strong> AQAP represents the Al-Qaeda branch that is most capable of conducting an operation targeting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, although operational limitations imposed by Yemens intractable civil war very likely will reduce AQAPs ability to launch such an attack. As noted by a recent UN Security Council report, despite battlefield setbacks in recent years, AQAP <a href=\"https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/S%202022%20547.pdf\">remains</a> a serious threat in Yemen and seeks to reconstitute its ability to conduct international operations. However, the realities of fighting a multifront war against the Houthis, Saudi-led coalition forces, and members of the Islamic States Yemen affiliate have required AQAP to <a href=\"https://acleddata.com/2020/12/14/the-wartime-transformation-of-aqap-in-yemen\">retrench</a> significantly. Aside from 2 attacks in 2019, occurring in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-security-stabbing/saudi-concert-stabbing-suspect-took-orders-from-al-qaeda-in-yemen-state-tv-idUSKBN1YN1C0\">Saudi Arabia</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/middleeast/al-qaeda-claims-it-directed-florida-naval-base-shooting.html\">US</a>, the group has <a href=\"https://www.counterextremism.com/threat/aqap-al-qaeda-arabian-peninsula\">focused</a> its operations on targets within Yemen  indicating that the World Cup presents an unlikely target. </p></li><li><p><strong>Lone Wolves </strong> Despite not <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/where-do-is-foreign-fighters-come-from/28853696.html\">sending</a> a significant number of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria during the rise of ISILs self-declared caliphate (and thus having a limited rate of returnee extremists), Qatar contends with an elevated risk of domestic violent extremism; a lone wolf attack targeting the World Cup is thus a possibility, although such an event is unlikely. In 1 social media study <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/28/support-isis-stronger-arabic-social-media-europe-us-than-syria\">conducted</a> in 2014, 47% of Qatar-based social media posts about ISIL expressed positive sentiment, a significant deviation from the much lower percentages found across Europe and the Middle East. Although the US Department of State believes Qatar is making strides in addressing violent extremism, its most recent country report pointedly <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2020/qatar\">observed</a> that state-supported intolerance, sectarianism, and violence is still found in textbooks and disseminated through media.</p></li></ul><h5 id=\"security-defenses\">Security Defenses</h5><p>Qatar has enhanced its own security in the lead-up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The government plans to <a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/news/263029-world-cup-to-use-drones-to-help-protect-stadiums/fulltext\">use</a> its own drones to enhance surveillance and security patrols, and the Qatari government reportedly <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/26/qatar-inks-global-security-partnerships-to-ensure-safe-world-cup\">deployed</a> 32,000 government security forces and 17,000 private security forces during a 5-day security exercise across the country in October 2022, indicating the scale of Qatars security defenses. Furthermore, Qatar is receiving security assistance from multiple countries for the duration of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, including:</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/07/05/joint-statement-between-us-department-homeland-security-and-ministry-interior-state\">US</a>: the US made a number of commitments to strengthen Qatars event security, port security, screening, contraband interdiction, and risk management capabilities, such as helping Qatar to identify air passengers linked to terrorism and trafficking of narcotics, weapons, currency, and people. The New York Police Department also <a href=\"https://dohanews.co/nypd-exchanges-expertise-with-qatar-police-ahead-of-2022-world-cup\">met</a> with Qatars police forces to exchange expertise. More recent memorandums of understanding have been <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-the-u-s-qatar-strategic-dialogue\">signed</a> between the US and Qatar on defense cooperation around the 2022 FIFA World Cup. </li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-raf-and-royal-navy-support-to-qatar-world-cup-2022\">UK</a>: the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy will support Qatar with military capabilities to counter terrorism and other threats to the tournament including maritime security support from the Royal Navy, advanced venue search training, operational planning and command and control support, and further specialist advice. </li><li><a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/sport/20221006-france-to-contribute-officers-to-world-cup-security-in-qatar-amid-calls-for-boycott\">France</a>: France is sending around 220 police officers to provide high-level expertise and specialised logistical support. The officers primarily consist of anti-drone policing, in addition to bomb-disposal experts, sniffer dogs, anti-terror police, and police offers specialized in tackling football hooliganism. Other French support <a href=\"https://dohanews.co/us-armed-forces-to-support-qatar-defence-during-world-cup\">reportedly</a> includes a BASSALT anti-drone system that detects and identifies incoming drones and an E-3F Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. </li><li><a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/08/qatar-boosts-drone-defenses-ahead-fifa-world-cup\">Italy</a>: the Italian Air Force is deploying a Counter-Unmanned Aerial Anti-Drone Task group to further support the Qatari Armed Forces' defense against UAS, with Italian armed forces troops being stationed in the country during the tournament. </li><li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/turkey-sending-3000-police-qatar-help-secure-world-cup-2022-09-23\">Trkiye</a>: Trkiye is providing 3,000 riot police, 100 special operations police, 50 bomb specialists, and 80 sniffer dogs and riot dogs to Qatar. </li><li><a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20221011-pakistan-army-contingent-leaves-for-qatar-to-provide-world-cup-security\">Pakistan</a>: Pakistan is sending an army contingent to provide security during the tournament.</li><li><a href=\"https://dohanews.co/jordan-keen-on-providing-qatar-security-support-during-world-cup\">Jordan</a>: Jordan expressed its willingness to assist with security at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with reports <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/jordan/2022/10/31/jordanian-ex-soldiers-to-return-from-qatar-after-world-cup-salary-dispute\">stating</a> that as many as 6,000 ex-Jordanian soldiers were hired into security jobs for the tournament, some of whom have allegedly returned to Jordan after a salary dispute.</li></ul><p>An additional mitigating factor decreasing the threat of terrorism to the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatars geographical orientation. Qatar only shares 1 land border with Saudi Arabia and is a peninsula in the Persian Gulf. The border with Saudi Arabia is isolated, has a flat desert topography, and is small enough for security forces to control. While the borders of Bahrain and the UAE are only roughly 10 to 20 miles across the Persian Gulf, these countries, like Saudi Arabia, have cordial relations with Qatar and are not primary incubators of terrorist groups that would seek to target Qatar. A lack of accessible ingress opportunities for terrorist organizations into Qatar, along with Qatar's security defenses discussed above, mitigate (but do not eliminate) the threat of terrorism to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><h4 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h4><p>Qatars unique geopolitical position on a contentious global stage means its unlikely that state-sponsored APT groups from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea will conduct a disruptive attack against the 2022 FIFA World Cup, despite Russia having the greatest motivations for doing so. Instead, nationalistic Russian hacktivist groups or ransomware operators could conduct disruptive attacks against the tournament, which as previously noted can provide the Kremlin with plausible deniability. </p><p>Cybercriminal phishing attacks are almost certainly going to continue throughout the 2022 FIFA World Cup tournament, before dispersing after the tournament concludes. Its very unlikely that tournament-themed phishing attacks targeting businesses will continue to use lures that invite victims to bid on contracts or supply goods or services to the tournament given that the tournament begins soon. </p><p>It is very likely that Iran and Russia will continue to highlight divisions and exacerbate tensions between Qatar and Western countries that are critical of the tournament being hosted in Qatar, while also promoting their own bilateral relations. Furthermore, Iran, China, and Russia are likely to use the 2022 FIFA World Cup in future influence operations as an example of where the West has sought to impose Western values on other countries. </p><p>Finally, Qatar is unlikely to face a major physical security threat during the 2022 FIFA World Cup based on the factors explained above. Although Iran, China, Russia are emphasizing and promoting bilateral relations with Qatar through discourse, countries like the US, UK, France, Italy, Trkiye, and others are providing material security assistance to Qatar for the tournament. This security assistance, building on other <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-qatar\">security cooperation</a>, in addition to the US formally designating Qatar as a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-designates-qatar-major-non-nato-ally-us-2022-03-10\">major non-NATO ally</a> in March 2022, is likely to lead to further security cooperation between Qatar and Western countries. </p><p><em>The sources used in this report are the Recorded Future Platform and open sources.</em></p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Hoax in the Machine: Disinformation Against Voting Systems Manufacturers and Technologies in the 2022 US Midterm Elections Report", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Hoax in the Machine: Disinformation Against Voting Systems Manufacturers and Technologies in the 2022 US Midterm Elections Report"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/hoax-in-the-machine-disinformation-against-voting-systems-in-the-2022-us-midterm-elections"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/hoax_in_the_machine_disinformation_against_voting_systems_in_the_2022_us_midterm_elections_cover_fe118b9cd5.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/hoax-in-the-machine-disinformation-against-voting-systems-in-the-2022-us-midterm-elections", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/hoax-in-the-machine-disinformation-against-voting-systems-in-the-2022-us-midterm-elections", "guidislink": false, "published": "Mon, 07 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 11, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 311, 0], "summary": "Russian influence operations have catalyzed distrust in the machines and the election process.

While we acknowledge that voting technologies have faced a long history of criticisms in the US, we intentionally focus this report on election infrastructure disinformation and influence efforts generated between the 2020 general election and the 2022 midterm elections.</p><h4 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h4><p>Recorded Future has observed substantial evidence of misinformation and disinformation targeting voting systems manufacturers (VSMs) across both mainstream and alternative internet platforms ahead of the 2022 US midterm elections. Disinformation involving voting technologies intends to instill doubt in electoral results and distrust of the US electoral system broadly. The <a href=\"https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/registered-manufacturers\">key players</a> providing voting technologies for jurisdictions across the US remained largely the same between 2020 and 2022, and 2022 midterms-oriented disinformation is likely to continue to target those manufacturers who are already well-known: <a href=\"https://www.dominionvoting.com\">Dominion Voting Systems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.essvote.com\">Election Systems &amp; Software</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.smartmatic.com/us\">Smartmatic</a>.</p><p>False claims are already circulating that voting technologies developed and deployed by these 3 well-known VSMs will be used to falsify the results of the midterms. Misinformation and disinformation targeting these companies will almost certainly continue to be generated from existing election denialist cohorts on the political right, though we expect a decrease in the intensity of such efforts when compared to the 2020 elections due to the absence of former president Donald Trump from the ballot in the 2022 midterm elections and because midterms elections typically garner less public attention than presidential elections. Additionally, it is likely that misinformation and disinformation surrounding voting technologies will be most prominent in jurisdictions that are facing particularly contentious races, such as the gubernatorial elections in Arizona and Pennsylvania and the Senate election in Georgia.</p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>The VSMs most likely to be targeted by misinformation and disinformation following the 2022 midterms are Dominion Voting Systems, Smartmatic, and Election Systems &amp; Software. </li><li>Recorded Future has already identified claims across numerous facets of the mainstream and alternative social media landscape suggesting that technologies deployed by the aforementioned companies will be used to falsify the results of the midterms.</li><li>Prominent political figures will almost certainly give voice to false information related to voting technologies in use for the 2022 midterms in counties in which their preferred candidate(s) lose the popular vote. This especially applies to those VSMs administering elections in jurisdictions with contentious races that are either highly publicized or in crucial swing states or jurisdictions.</li><li>The vast majority of false information targeting VSMs is likely to originate from domestic sources in the US rather than from foreign influence. However, it is likely that foreign state-owned media organizations will amplify false claims to increase domestic distrust in US elections.</li><li>We believe that while there will almost certainly be new disinformation efforts targeting VSMs following the 2022 midterms, the intensity of these claims will be lessened in comparison with the 2020 general election due to the absence of Donald Trump from the ballot and because midterm elections typically garner less public attention when compared to a general election.</li></ul><h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4><p>The 2022 US midterm election cycle faces targeted disinformation and influence efforts intended to instill doubt in electoral results and distrust of the US electoral system broadly. These efforts target every facet of the electoral process, including local, state, and federal authorities, political candidates, election administrators and poll workers, voting dates and methods, and VSMs and their technologies, the last of which is the focus for this report. Voting technologies have faced both <a href=\"https://votingsystems.cdn.sos.ca.gov/dominion-voting/red-team-support.pdf\">legitimate</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/2016-elections-russia-hack-how-to-hack-an-election-in-seven-minutes-214144\">criticism</a> and misinformation and disinformation; disinformation often, but not always, builds on false claims made in works of misinformation.</p><p>Disinformation around voting technologies seeks to attack a foundational component of democracy: that the electorate decides who will represent them in government. Undermining this foundation poses a threat to the continuation of democratic norms and social stability. The US has faced this challenge at an extraordinary scale since the 2020 general election with the spread of the Big Lie theory, which is very likely to affect the 2022 midterm elections. The Big Lie refers to a theory, most popularly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-tweets-he-won-not-conceding-9ce22e9dc90577f7365d150c151a91c7\">asserted</a> by former president Donald Trump, that the 2020 election was hacked, rigged, and stolen by a variety of anti-Trump actors in order to engineer President Joe Bidens electoral victory. The responsible culprits allegedly included powerful individuals like billionaire <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/factsfirst/politics/factcheck_829bf37c-cbd5-4a5c-8d87-7e53504997cb\">George Soros</a> and the Clintons, nation-states like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shannen.rowedubose/posts/3634766126559921\">Italy</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-legal-team-false-claims-5abd64917ef8be9e9e2078180973e8b3\">Venezuela</a>, poll workers like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dn48fcHkFw&amp;ab_channel=PBSNewsHour\">Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman</a>, election administrators like Philadelphia's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/magazine/trump-election-philadelphia-republican.html\">Al Schmidt</a>, so-called deep state intelligence agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4v3Stm6aBY&amp;ab_channel=CBNNews\">CIA</a>), and VSMs like those discussed in this report. The Big Lie is the primary conspiracy theory around which US election denialist conspiracy theories are framed, and the Big Lie was the primary catalyst that led to the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p><p>According to the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC), <a href=\"https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/registered-manufacturers\">11 registered voting systems manufacturers</a> meet the safety requirements laid out in the EACs <a href=\"https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/28/Cert%20Manual%207%208%2015%20FINAL.pdf\">Testing and Certification Program Manual</a>: (alphabetically) Avante International Technology, Inc., Clear Ballot Group, Inc., Dominion Voting Systems Corp., Election Systems &amp; Software, Inc.

Voting systems manufacturers create both software and hardware election administration tools, both of which have been discussed in various election denialist conspiracies.</p><p>This report focuses on the companies and manufacturers that have been, and are most likely to continue to be, the targets of disinformation in the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2022 US midterms. We base our likelihood assessment on our analysis of current trends in VSM-focused disinformation and  the use of equipment or software from particular vendors in contentious elections across the US. On these grounds, we focus this research on disinformation targeting voting technologies from Dominion Voting Systems, ES&amp;S, and Smartmatic USA. We also include a brief discussion of Scytl, a VSM that is not 1 of the 11 registered with the US EAC but that featured prominently in some of the most viral disinformation targeting voting technologies after 2020. </p><p>While no election jurisdiction is immune to VSM disinformation, some, because of their strategic political positions, are likely to be targeted more than others. The following states (and smaller election jurisdictions within them) are <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/16/1014633/data-shows-swing-state-voters-more-local-disinformation\">most likely</a> to be the targets of continual VSM disinformation efforts: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-congress-donald-trump-3c315861315cdb483fe4c72560dac909\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/wisconsin-election-denial-races-election-administration-positions\">Wisconsin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/10/16/arizona-kari-lake-midterm-election-denial-trump\">Arizona</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/us/politics/pennsylvania-midterm-elections.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-rural-nevada-became-the-next-battleground-for-the-big-lie\">Nevada</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/florida-election-denial-races-election-administration-positions\">Florida</a>.</p><h4 id=\"disinformation-targeting-voting-systems-manufacturers\">Disinformation Targeting Voting Systems Manufacturers</h4><p>The following section documents viral misinformation and disinformation (of unknown origin) and directed disinformation campaigns (foreign and domestic) against the aforementioned VSMs within the last 2 years. At the time of writing, we expect that these manufacturers will continue to be targets of these existing and new misinformation and disinformation efforts before, during, and following the 2022 midterms, particularly in jurisdictions with histories of election denialism. </p><p>Because these manufacturers service elections in many countries around the world, some of the false information about them is focused on alleged international scandals.

As early as November 6, 2020, an <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/sos/Resources/News/2020/11/06/false-claims-from-ronna-mcdaniel-have-no-merit\">irregularity</a> in Antrim County, Michigan, initially resulted in the county being called for Biden instead of Trump by county election administrators. Though an audit revealed this to be due to <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/sos/resources/news/2021/03/26/expert-report-affirms-accuracy-of-antrim-county-presidential-election-results\">human error</a> (failure to update software components), rather than any software or hardware supplied by Dominion, and the county was correctly called for Trump in the end, viral <a href=\"https://www.depernolaw.com/uploads/2/7/0/2/27029178/antrim_michigan_forensics_report_%5b121320%5d_v2_%5bredacted%5d.pdf\">rumors</a> baselessly <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/audit-in-michigan-county-refutes-dominion-conspiracy-theory\">alleged</a> that Dominion software was intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results.</p><p>Dominions technology serviced 28 states in the 2020 election, and early denialists quickly wove the Antrim County miscount into a broader narrative of national election fraud. There is strong evidence, presented at the end of 2021 to the <a href=\"https://january6th.house.gov\">Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the United States Capitol</a>, to suggest that the intentional misrepresentation of Dominion voting technologies in Antrim Country was part of a broader plan to discredit 2020 presidential election results, as laid out in a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/january-6-clearinghouse-strategic-communications-plan-giuliani-presidential-legal-defense-team-bernard-kerik-documents.pdf\">Strategic Communications Plan</a> used by the [Rudy] <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/31/kerik-documents-jan-6-committee-526297\">Giuliani Presidential Defense Team</a>.</p><p>Pseudo-legal documents and affidavits surfaced, authored by persons who claimed to have directly witnessed vote tampering or whose professional expertise allowed them to determine that digital fraud had taken place. One such example, a forensics report written by Bill Bailey and entered into an Antrim County lawsuit by election denialist lawyer Matthew DePerno, alleged that Dominion software was designed to [generate] an enormously high number of ballot errors. The claim was, and remains, a cornerstone of election denialist disinformation concerning both the 2020 and upcoming 2022 elections. Former President Trumps own claims of Dominion election fraud further secured the false narrative through the present day. On November 12, 2020, Trump <a href=\"https://www.thetrumparchive.com/?searchbox=%22REPORT%3A+DOMINION+DELETED+2.7+MILLION+TRUMP+VOTES+NATIONWIDE.+DATA+ANALYSIS+FINDS+221%2C000+PENNSYLVANIA+VOTES+SWITCHED+FROM+PRESIDENT%22\">said on social media</a>:</p><blockquote><p>REPORT: DOMINION DELETED 2.7 MILLION TRUMP VOTES NATIONWIDE.

In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Fox News <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20527880-dominion-v-fox-news-complaint\">made</a> multiple unsubstantiated and false on-air claims that reportedly included the following:</p><ul><li>Smartmatic is a Venezuelan company <a href=\"https://gab.com/SwissBrisQ/posts/109159706612408373\">under control</a> of the deceased dictator Hugo Chavez.</li><li>Smartmatic provided voting technologies for elections in 6 key swing states.</li><li>Smartmatic software was engineered to change votes from Trump to Biden.</li><li>Smartmatic software was used in concert with Dominion Voting Systems hardware, and Smartmatic covertly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9740535009\">owned</a> Dominion.</li><li>Smartmatic software sent votes <a href=\"https://texags.com/forums/16/topics/3159296\">abroad</a> for tabulation.</li></ul><p>Smartmatic itself has <a href=\"https://www.smartmatic.com/us/media/article/smartmatic-s-response-to-misinformation\">corrected</a> many of these allegations, noting specifically that the only place Smartmatic technology was used in the 2020 election was in Los Angeles (LA) County. Despite this, disinformation echoing these claims persists across alternative internet spaces and on alternative news media. </p><p>Disinformation concerning Smartmatics administration of elections has spanned the globe since before 2020. In 2018, Danish tabloid Berlingske <a href=\"https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/skattely-og-korruption-udskaeldt-firma-fra-venezuela-skal-bygge-danmarks-nye\">published</a> an article claiming that the disgraced company from Venezuela would be building Denmarks electoral system, with 4chan users recently <a href=\"https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/smartmatic\">citing</a> on October 14, 2022, the false link between Smartmatic and Venezuela to support their belief that the company is corrupt. On 4chan, Smartmatic and other entities believed to be part of a popular anti-Semitic conspiracy theory postulating a grand plot for Jewish world domination are expressed with 3 parentheticals on either side, an internet shorthand for alleged Jewish corruption (expressed <a href=\"https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/398004767/#398007172\">(((Smartmatic)))</a>). This denotes a common overlap between election-related disinformation and older, grandiose anti-Semitic conspiracies about Jewish world domination. </p><p>Recorded Future discovered multiple instances of misinformation and disinformation targeting Smartmatic with corruption and rigging claims: an Italian-language post on <a href=\"https://gab.com/WittieKittie/posts/109164931790713732\">Gab</a> speculated about relationships between Smartmatic and the Clintons, allegations on Patriots[.]win claimed that the 2022 Argentina election was <a href=\"https://patriots.win/p/15IXtz84kK/argentina-elected-a-leftist-gove/c\">rigged</a> by Smartmatic machines, and the English-language <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0628\">Federal Security Service-directed</a> site SouthFront[.]org claimed that there is a British hand behind the US coup, stating that a British spy agent is a key figure controlling Smartmatic.

Despite the companys small market share, LA Countys size and prominence on the national stage will likely result in continued misinformation and disinformation targeting Smartmatics technology and business practices.

Recorded Future has not identified any additional reliable sources corroborating the investigation, but the very rumor of the investigation itself, echoed by election denialist outlets  , will almost certainly feed any allegations of corruption in jurisdictions using Smartmatic technology in the US. As in 2020, it is also likely that conspiracists will insist that Smartmatic technology was used in other jurisdictions where their favored candidates lose, such as those jurisdictions that use Dominion hardware. Previous Smartmatic conspiracy theories have alleged that Smartmatic provides software to Dominion machines; both parties have denied this as the companies are competitors.</p><h5 id=\"election-systems--software-inc-ess\">Election Systems &amp; Software, Inc.

Past systems failures increase the skepticism of technology and foment public distrust in the reliability of election results. Influence actors can manipulate historic malfunctions to create present fears.</li><li><strong>Lack of Government Communication.</strong> Election authorities do not always make clear how voting technologies function or a jurisdiction's process for vetting and selecting vendors. The salience of some false information <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo6254\">may be reduced</a> if trusted government or election authorities focus on educating the electorate. However, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2022.2031259\">recent studies</a> suggest that inoculation against disinformation must involve more than simple fact-checking.</li><li><strong>Political Instability, Corruption, and Conspiracies.</strong> Perceptions of government corruption very likely decrease trust in voting technologies, regardless of their actual performance or of information available about how they function. In 2021, Transparency[.]orgs <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/usa\">Corruption Perception Index</a> scored the US at 67 out of 100, with 100 indicating very high public trust. As demonstrated by the persistent state of election disinformation in the US since 2020, fact-checking, transparency, and education have been unable to compensate for lack of trust in government institutions and authority.</li></ul><h4 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h4><p>The US can almost certainly expect to see a continuation of misinformation and disinformation targeting voting systems manufacturers in the lead up to, during, and following the 2022 midterms. As in 2020, such misinformation and disinformation will very likely concentrate on elections in contentious battleground states and counties, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-congress-donald-trump-3c315861315cdb483fe4c72560dac909\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/wisconsin-election-denial-races-election-administration-positions\">Wisconsin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/10/16/arizona-kari-lake-midterm-election-denial-trump\">Arizona</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/us/politics/pennsylvania-midterm-elections.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-rural-nevada-became-the-next-battleground-for-the-big-lie\">Nevada</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/florida-election-denial-races-election-administration-positions\">Florida</a>. Election administrators in such jurisdictions should be prepared for hyper-scrutiny of both voting technologies used and administrators themselves in connection to the technologies functioning.</p><p>Additionally, it is very likely that experts aligned with election denialist views will write and publish additional statements claiming proof of voting technologies malfunctioning or intentional rigging in the hours, days, and weeks following the closing of polls on November 8. These persons are likely to be championed by existing election denialist circles, and such claims may generate lawsuits in multiple contentious jurisdictions. </p><p>According to the Brookings Institution, there are <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/10/07/democracy-on-the-ballot-how-many-election-deniers-are-on-the-ballot-in-november-and-what-is-their-likelihood-of-success\">more than 300 election denialists</a> running for public office in November. It is very likely that some of those who are unsuccessful in their races will pivot toward disinformation concerning unfavorable results, including disinformation against voting technologies, their manufacturers, and election administrators who are required to interact with said technologies. This is likely to result in <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dominion-voting-systems-ceo-machines-conspiracy-theories-60-minutes-2022-10-23/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7d&amp;linkId=186740643\">threats</a> against both personnel at the voting systems manufacturers and local election jurisdictions; after 2020, election administrators frequently <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/for-election-administrators-death-threats-have-become-part-of-the-job\">received</a> death threats.</p><p>Voting technologies can face legitimate errors during the electoral process, either as a function of human mishandling or by malfunction of the software or hardware itself. To have the best chance at reducing false information, it is paramount that VSMs acknowledge and explain such errors publicly as swiftly as possible.</p><p>Lastly, it is crucial to note that US election denialism and VSM disinformation harm the democratic world at large. Dominion, Smartmatic, and ES&amp;S will likely continue to face echoes of US-based conspiracies concerning their voting technologies in other elections around the world, as observed by Recorded Future and election watchdogs in <a href=\"https://www.aec.gov.au/media/disinformation-register.htm\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/22/1130336625/why-false-claims-about-brazils-election-are-spreading-in-far-right-u-s-circles\">Brazil</a>, <a href=\"https://manilastandard.net/news/national/339587/smartmatic-poll-machines-come-into-question.html\">the Philippines</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10160136885139116&amp;set=basw.AbpJbSiuLtNRnxHrCXHoVU-c8NnXEAKT6FATwog88rEJFbjREdwx9cYpJm4L2emsxGIV9jxH2Uh68Zxiluyrb-gD6zjAaWEi9TpGzlWvRRD-f9py0umwAH5TxcqwsljMjfeAk9c9CbbDhrJcO6FNts1w&amp;opaqueCursor=Abq988A1mzwXsx55DmIGD_8mAjjaBWClmiFANpgvQp-J8t_vXHeokZ5m2vtqpeBcifT6LCuP6BFCl8h7IUntaoAGluHApNlbJ0GaYi-0xA8-LaTdM1rC8NGlhnpLq2lewIyRDmaDgOmzyqBQ1VJfoEzUGJ9PVTVUP-dlcZVnnNq4IOQ_EJVyrtE-mDDZjoAEhLFe4BC9ylEWUXFFTCmx_jV2inMRfcrCi1-dlBBjycjrS5rZrfRiHDbUtiD6cSkPTD_k-57mtj2PeU9ol37mY-dyerqOMms_xS3jvcwTKvRx2mRjTCI_u_hBTEVzEaz16PnaJFzp6HgqXcl5Jbd7D4Nlj8nxIS-959tuZPinvDWuFomi5C7EnmNxin0qNYzFch7FAn2sSRx-V8iAaIo-CCgLMPU-Wljn22j1bJYhq84K-s6M90FUxvXjN97UTm7qrp6NqOYtS6OLaG32PG8Y1xmHnfzH-oLkfZ5xGyHXLKKzQrkAuyHUVjLHPnlGc6pmwNKsRE3SaJ8H1b-Dqpg8_IENqk2Crxj-6XsU2YDNBceJC5TRs4CAarN4c73_thM1mxCF6uURkl9ZCd71OWF6K0MrU5thglg9CkKvDiEZXuH5bMXYcL-O6LmvR045H5pgTiCKuOswiTU37u22lu_PumeC0_4nYexEXaf74G-1RUKwt1oyus0Vs5K1zuSSmV_mB_CLpYYyr9FuYVbbapan7QVW9kWCX67pEt_DLSkD2tyywXLr_CnpMjeI7eCLd-VQ25Cv3Am1tM0Ka49eBNieSGdGe4957hlcKETmT1Ai8sxd77nPq23sbmGnoBSyGMtbJDk\">Kenya</a>.  </p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Putin\u2019s Potential Successors Part 1: Sergei Kirienko Report", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Putin\u2019s Potential Successors Part 1: Sergei Kirienko Report"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/putin-potential-successors-part-1-sergei-kirienko"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/putin_potential_successors_part_1_sergei_kirienko_cover_87c823b23f.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/putin-potential-successors-part-1-sergei-kirienko", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/putin-potential-successors-part-1-sergei-kirienko", "guidislink": false, "published": "Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 11, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 308, 0], "summary": "Who would Vladimir Putin pick to replace him?

In this paper, we look at factors that we assess establish Kirienko as the frontrunner for Putins role and evaluate his adaptation during the war from a technocrat tasked with achieving the Kremlins domestic policy goals to a Kremlin official responsible for the successful integration and management of Ukrainian territories into Russia. The report is most likely of interest to governmental organizations, private sector companies, and non-governmental groups seeking to better understand Russias political elite.</p><h4 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h4><p>Vladimir Putin is in his fourth term as Russias president, having held the role for (a noncontiguous) 18 years. Russias next presidential election cycle is in 2024, and while Putin has amended the constitution to permit his rule until he is 84, speculations continue to circulate regarding his declining health at 70 years old.   Moreover, as domestic and international pressure continues to mount on Putin 8 months into Russias war against Ukraine, Putins longevity as the Federations president is a key topic of interest for the international community.  Insikt Groups investigation into potential Russian government candidates who are well positioned to be the next leader of Russia starts with the candidate we assess is most likely to assume power if Putin selects his successor: Sergei Kirienko.</p><p>Kirienko, the First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Administration of Russia, is currently the head of Russian domestic policy and has served in Russian public office since 1997. Since the beginning of the full-scale war in Ukraine, Kirienko assumed responsibility for the management and annexation of Russia-occupied regions in Ukraine. This move almost certainly won Kirienko Putins favor, advancing him into Putins inner circle and distinguishing him from other potential successors. Prior to this, Kirienkos long-term political career, including his successful tenures at the Presidential Administration, at Rosatom, and as the Presidential Representative to Volga Federal District, has very likely enabled him to prove his prowess as a leader within the Russian government and create critical relationships to promote his success in a higher office.   A Kirienko presidency would very likely be defined by his ability to adapt to new realities, avoid conflict, and maintain good relations with key actors. Importantly, Kirienkos ability to avoid conflict will likely lead him to pursue a more peaceful foreign policy. Domestically, Kirienkos rule is likely to be an extension of his current policies as the curator of domestic policy, and it is very likely that he would not substantially reform the Russian political system.</p><h4 id=\"key-judgments\">Key Judgments</h4><ul><li>Kirienkos role in Russias war against Ukraine has almost certainly distinguished him from other members of the Russian elite, enabling him to join Putins inner circle and enjoy near-daily access to Putin. </li><li>As a longtime member of the Russian elite with proven loyalty to Putin, Kirienko has established himself as a talented leader with public-facing political experience, which very likely will increase his attractiveness as a potential successor to Putin.</li><li>Kirienkos relatively good relations with the <em>siloviki</em> faction, the oligarchs, and in-system liberals very likely set him up to be accepted by all major stakeholders of the Russian political elite should he be selected as a Presidential successor. </li><li>A potential Kirienko presidency would likely feature a more peaceful international strategy compared to that of Putins foreign policy objectives, with Kirienko instead continuing to prioritize domestic policies.</li></ul><h4 id=\"kirienko-as-the-next-tsar\">Kirienko as the Next Tsar</h4><p>Sergei Kirienko is the likely frontrunner in the successor race due to his support of Putins grandiose vision for Russia, his ability to achieve goals set by the Kremlin, and good relations with all major Russian political elite stakeholders. Additionally, Kirienko has near-daily access to Putin in his current position as the curator of Russian domestic policy and newly annexed Ukrainian territories, further strengthening his potential candidacy. Kirienkos ability to foster Putins friendship and trust will very likely lead him to a politically advantageous position.</p><h5 id=\"support-for-putins-vision-of-russian-grandeur\">Support For Putins Vision of Russian Grandeur</h5><p>Kirienkos lasting and continued support for Putin and his ambitions of a resurgent Russia is one of the most compelling factors when considering his potential successor. By echoing Putins statements of rebuilding a great Russia and reclaiming historic Russian territories, Kirienko has positioned himself at the forefront of the war party that emerged following Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He has also made several public statements repeating Putins claims that the war was necessitated by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion and that Russias invasion was necessary to denazify and demilitarize Ukraine, as well as to liberate the people of Ukraine. These efforts closely aligned Kirienko with Putins prioritization of Ukraine.</p><p>By at least late April 2022, reports indicated Kirienko made a critical political decision by independently assuming the responsibility for managing and integrating the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics (DPR; LPR) and other Russian-occupied regions into the Russian Federation.  He reportedly stepped into this role on his own accord while also maintaining his position as domestic policy curator, further demonstrating Kirienkos dedication to Putins initiatives. Kirienkos public support of the war and new position improved his standing and won him additional access to Putin, particularly as very few of Russias elite or high-ranking officials demonstrated similar dedication to Putins priorities. This is evidenced by Kirienkos ascension to Putins inner circle after the start of the war, enabling him to enjoy near-daily access to the Russian president and benefit from the influence that creates.</p><p><img alt=\"putin_potential_successors_part_1_sergei_kirienko_figure_1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/putin_potential_successors_part_1_sergei_kirienko_figure_1_80d7e597e4.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1: Kirienko at the opening of the Grandma for Donbas statue in Mariupol on May 5, 2022. (Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-61339363\">BBC</a>)</strong></p><p>As the Kremlins curator for Russia-occupied territories in Ukraine, Kirienko took responsibility for organizing local governments in these territories. To do this, Kirienko directed Andrey Yarin, Chief of the Presidential Domestic Policy Directorate, to hire policy experts to work in civilian-military administrations in new territories occupied by the Russian military. These administrations were primarily tasked with organizing fake referendums to legally annex Ukrainian territory into Russia, and they now manage the regions, post-annexation. The highest public appointments under Kirienkos control were that of Vitaly Khotsenko to the post of Prime Minister of the DPR and Vladislav Kuznetsov to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the LPR government. Both of these individuals were 2019 finalists of Kirienkos Leaders of Russia program, which he created to identify and train the next generation of political leaders. The program has at least 370 graduates, many of whom hold high-level public and private sector positions, including current governors, deputy ministers, and heads of regional ministries, all with continued allegiance to Kirienko for his role in their careers. Kirienko can almost certainly leverage these officials in the future to ensure he has sufficient political momentum and support for his initiatives.</p><p>Additionally, in July 2022, Kirienko announced a patronage system for Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. As a result, several Russian regions were tasked with funding the rebuilding of cities in Russia-occupied regions in Ukraine. Meduza reported that while Moscow and Saint Petersburg were allowed to choose their respective regions to provide patronage, other Russian regions were assigned cities and regions by the Kremlin. As Kirienko is responsible for managing Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, the newly announced patronage system very likely gives Kirienko further power over Russian governors, including the regional governors of Moscow and Saint Petersburg.</p><h5 id=\"kirienko-the-leader-before-the-war\">Kirienko the Leader: Before the War</h5><p>Kirienkos influence extends beyond his efforts in Ukraine. Before the start of the war, Kirienko was primarily known as one of the Russian government's leading and most effective technocrats.  Throughout his extensive career, which has ranged from serving as prime minister of Russia in 1998 to curating Russian domestic policy, Kirienko has solidified himself as an excellent leader capable of achieving the Kremlins goals without posing a political threat to Putin.  His most prominent successes include the centralization of the Volga Federal District, the revitalization of the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom, and the organization of successful (that is, preferential to Putin) elections in Russia.   Kirienkos ability to achieve the Kremlins objectives in each position he has held almost certainly strengthens his candidacy as the most likely successor to Putin. </p><p>At the start of his career, Kirienko demonstrated the ability to adapt to new realities and pursue opportunities that springboarded him to the heights of the Russian political environment. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kirienko pursued business opportunities, quickly adapting to a new market economy. In 1993, Kirienko founded and became the chairman of Garantia Bank, where he built close relations with Boris Nemtsov, then-governor of Nizhny Novgorod. This friendship resulted in Kirienkos bank receiving authorization to conduct financial operations for many of the social programs introduced by Nemtsov. When Nemtsov was appointed as the Minister for Oil and Energy, he brought his protege Kirienko to Moscow to serve as the Deputy Minister for Oil and Energy; it is largely believed, however, that Kirienko directed the ministry himself. In Moscow, Kirienko quickly rose through the ranks, and by March 1998, he became Russias youngest prime minister. His tenure, however, was cut short when the government announced a default on Russian foreign debt in August 1998. </p><p>Despite his short tenure as the prime minister of Russia, Kirienko proved himself able to take advantage of the new power structure. He further proved his flexibility and prowess as a politician and diplomat when he was appointed as the Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Volga Federal District in 2000. In this position, Kirienko was tasked with quelling regional autonomy and bringing the district governors under greater control of the Kremlin. In the 5 years he served in this role, Kirienko was able to bring all the regions, including Tatarstan in 2007, under greater Kremlin control.</p><p><img alt=\"putin_potential_successors_part_1_sergei_kirienko_figure_2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/putin_potential_successors_part_1_sergei_kirienko_figure_2_762874b411.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 2: Kirienko with Vladimir Putin at the meeting of the Russian Pobeda (Victory) Organizing Committee in 2019 (Source: <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/russias-establishment-turns-militant-on-ukraine\">CEPA</a>)</strong></p><p>As the head of Rosatom and the curator for domestic policy, Kirienko established himself as a capable leader, able to advance Kremlin interests regardless of the environment. Specifically, as the head of Rosatom, Kirienko effectively navigated the Russian military-industrial complex while building a world-renowned nuclear energy exporter. He centralized the nuclear industry under the umbrella of Rosatom, achieved relative independence from the military, and conquered international nuclear power plant markets. As the curator for Russian domestic policy, Kirienko managed all domestic policy figures, arranged federal and regional level elections, and silenced the opposition.</p><h5 id=\"kirienko-the-diplomat\">Kirienko the Diplomat</h5><p>Throughout Kirienkos vast career experience, one of his most marked achievements has been maintaining relatively positive relations with the crucial political elites of the Russian government. Good relations with the Russian elite, especially with Putin himself, almost certainly contribute to Kirienkos candidacy as Putins successor. Throughout his entire career, Kirienko established himself as Putins loyal supporter. More importantly, Kirienko aided Putins rise to power, lobbying for Putins appointment as the head of the Federal Security Service of Russia (FSB) in 1998.  Relations between the two improved even further after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as detailed earlier in this report. For this, his proven loyalty, and help in Putins early political career, Kirienko very likely enjoys Putin's protection.</p><p><img alt=\"putin_potential_successors_part_1_sergei_kirienko_figure_3.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/putin_potential_successors_part_1_sergei_kirienko_figure_3_2f352ca369.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 3: Kirienko announcing Putins promotion to the head of the FSB in 1998 (Source: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/auSSx2JjG4s?t=44\">YouTube</a>)</strong></p><p>Kirienko also maintains relatively good relations with the <em>siloviki</em> faction as a whole. His first experience with the <em>siloviki</em>, a Russian political class that includes current and former members of the law and security structures, dates back to Kirienkos Rosatom days, when he had to balance the military with the civilian side of the nuclear industry. These relations became tense as Kirienko was appointed as the curator of Russian domestic policy, a position Kirienko still holds today. In this position, Kirienko works closely with the <em>siloviki</em> to maintain order and peace domestically. While Kirienko ranks higher than anyone in the <em>siloviki</em> faction when it comes to domestic issues, some members individually outrank Kirienko, creating the potential for a power imbalance. However, Kirienko and the <em>siloviki</em> remain in good standing, demonstrating lasting mutual respect.</p><p>Since the beginning of the full-scale war in Ukraine, Kirienko has further strengthened this relationship by actively working with the <em>siloviki</em> faction on matters related to Ukraine. As Kirienko took responsibility for the management and the formal annexation of Russia-occupied Ukrainian territories, Kirienko and his team began closely cooperating with the Russian military, intelligence services, and other members of the <em>siloviki</em> faction. The pro-Russian authorities in occupied territories are appointed by Kirienko and his team. These authorities are called military-civilian administrations for their close collaboration with the Russian military, further proving Kirienkos cooperation with the <em>siloviki</em> faction.</p><p>Finally, while Kirienko does not have extensive experience and cooperation with Russian oligarchs, he reportedly maintains close relations with brothers Mikhail and Yury Kovalchuk. The pair are Russian media tycoons, beneficiaries of the Bank of Russia, and Putins close friends. The brothers enjoy good relations with a number of the Russian elite, especially among the <em>siloviki</em> faction, including Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Secretary of the Security Council of Russia and former head of the FSB Nikolai Patrushev, and First Deputy Director of the FSB Sergei Korolev. Kirienko developed close ties to the brothers during his days as the head of Rosatom. Mikhail Kovalchuk is the president of the Kurchatov Institute, Russia's leading research and development institution in nuclear energy. Their relations appear to extend to their families: Boris Kovalchuk, Yurys son, briefly served as the deputy general director at Rosatom in 2009, and in 2021, Kirienkos son Vladimir was appointed as the head of the Kovalchuk-owned VKontakte Russian social media service. It is rumored that the Kovalchuks lobbied for Kirienkos return to the Kremlin to add another member of the Russian elite to their arsenal.</p><h4 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h4><p>In a scenario where Putin selects his successor, Kirienkos consistent allegiance to Putins strategic priorities and longstanding history of leadership in Russias government leaves him well-posed to replace Putin. Moreover, Kirienkos efforts to support Putins objectives regarding the DPR and LPR will very likely protect him from the consequences of additional failures in Ukraine, whereas Russias military leaders will almost certainly be subject to Putins punishment, as has already been the case with numerous military leaders including Admiral Igor Osipov and General Dmitry Bulgakov.  As the situation in Ukraine continues to change rapidly, Kirienkos proven experience adapting to changing socio-political circumstances will very likely enable him to maintain close relations with Putin, even as that access becomes more limited for higher members of Russias elite.</p><p>Kirienkos current and previous roles provide insight into how he would likely approach the presidential office. Kirienko has shown a remarkable capability to adapt to new realities, avoid conflict, and pursue friendly relations with key shareholders to advance his career. This, as well as his current position in office, would very likely define Kireinkos rule. For example, his strategy of avoiding conflict and making allegiances throughout the Russian government would likely continue as president. This would likely extend to some degree to foreign relations, particularly given Kirienkos history of embodying technocratic ideals. Moreover, despite Kirienkos embodying some authoritarian ideals, his history of peace-seeking could improve tensions with the West. Prior to the war, Kirienko largely refrained from speaking about foreign relations, even when he engaged in business that required it at Rosatom. Instead, Kirienko used business deals as tools of foreign policy rather than publicly reflecting his opinion on foreign states, providing him a relatively blank slate for foreign policy priorities in a potential presidency. Lastly, Kirienkos vast experience with domestic policy will very likely shape his presidency. Unlike Putin, who has largely ignored the domestic situation in Russia, Kirienko would likely expect his current priorities for domestic life, including building a meritocracy-based government, to continue under his presidency.</p><p>Notably, Kirienkos political career has made him an expert at strategically aligning himself with important figures. Particularly as he stood with Putin during Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kirienkos statements have strongly advocated in favor of the war and appear to reflect the viewpoint of the current administration. However, whether this is solely to gain Putins favor or reflects his true sentiments on the issue remains unclear.</p><p>Upcoming Insikt Group reports will investigate some of Putins alternate choices for president, including Alexey Dyumin, the current governor of Tula and former chief security guard of Putin, Sergei Sobianin, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Korolev, the First Deputy Director of the FSB, and Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft and unofficial head of the <em>siloviki</em> faction. We will also provide overviews of well-known candidates we assess are less likely to be appointed, such as Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russias Security Council and former president and prime minister of Russia, Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of the State Duma; and Sergei Shoigu, defense minister of Russia.</p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}, {"title": "Discovering Exchange Servers: Leveling the Field Using Attack Surface Intelligence", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Discovering Exchange Servers: Leveling the Field Using Attack Surface Intelligence"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/discovering-exchange-servers"}, {"length": "0", "type": "image/jpg", "href": "https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2022_1103_Blog_Discovering_Exchange_Servers_Main_Feature_804c601ae1.jpg", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/discovering-exchange-servers", "id": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/discovering-exchange-servers", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT", "published_parsed": [2022, 11, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 307, 0], "summary": "Learn how to discover Microsoft Exchange servers in the wild, along with popular and new vulnerabilities, to keep your inventory updated with ASI\u2019s SQL Explorer", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "Learn how to discover Microsoft Exchange servers in the wild, along with popular and new vulnerabilities, to keep your inventory updated with ASI\u2019s SQL Explorer"}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.recordedfuture.com/feed", "value": "<p><strong>Microsoft Exchange</strong>, the foundational server technology behind the worlds most popular enterprise email and scheduling ecosystem, has recently turned twenty-six. Over the years, the term Exchange has become synonymous with aspects of both work and personal life, like office integration or simplified calendar sharing; in short, a household name for all things productivity.</p><p>But with every rolling upgrade came the added complexities  in fact, Exchange Servers long-standing, coexisting requirements and tightly coupled domain dependencies have routinely introduced important security challenges, making it a consistent target for threat actors worldwide. Last year alone, for example, several Exchange Server versions experienced a total of <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-26/product_id-194/year-2021/opec-1/Microsoft-Exchange-Server.html\">18 remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities</a>, from low to medium complexity, and spanning severity scores of 6.5 through 10  two more RCEs than the last ten years combined. Racing to take advantage of some of these exploits, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers\">Hafnium</a> were soon observed targeting public-facing Exchange infrastructure while forcing Microsoft to release a sleuth of out-of-band security patches and updates to contend with the emerging attack surface.</p><p>Following up on the <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/zero-day-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities\">recent</a> two Exchange vulnerabilities, well go into some detail to describe the tools and methodologies used to detect the presence of web-facing Exchange servers, particularly through the lens of <strong>Attack Surface Intelligence</strong>  a new attack surface reduction paradigm designed from the ground up to assist with continuous asset discovery and monitoring  as well as the different ways to spot any Exchange server using well-known paths, as any attacker would.</p><h4 id=\"exchange-hosting-past-vs-present\">Exchange hosting: past vs. present</h4><p>With the growing popularity of the cloud, Exchange servers that had previously been housed on-premise, or in a more legacy fashion (e.g., locally at a business site), are progressively starting to reap the expected benefits of hosted solutions. These new standards are primarily driven by the need to employ cost-sensitive measures while minimizing downtime and similar shortcomings.</p><p>Hosted Exchange, for instance, is usually carried through third parties and resellers, although you can procure these services directly from Microsoft via (you guessed it) Exchange Online. With no hardware or software to buy or maintain, these offerings are as appealing as they are reliable. Exchange Online, for example, is a subset of Office 365 that offers enterprise-class protection and data safeguarding. In true Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) fashion, admin portals provide a one-stop shop for a wide range of features beyond simple mail and calendar flows, while anti-malware and filtering mechanisms ensure mail undergoes rigorous scrutiny.</p><p>However, what is distinctive of hosted solutions doesnt apply to in-house approaches. That is mainly because in-house Exchange servers require a considerable amount of IT resources to ensure that not only are they properly configured and maintained but also that security best practices are judiciously observed.</p><p><img alt=\"discovering_exchange_servers_figure_1.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/discovering_exchange_servers_figure_1_0ece6b854f.png\" /></p><p><strong>Figure 1: The Exchange Server exploit chain known as ProxyLogon - Source: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks-taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities\">Microsoft</a></strong></p><p>ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855) is a case in point. An entire attack surface (see above) allowed threat actors to bypass authentication mechanisms and grab system privileges via an open 443 port  a port typically associated with web-facing components of on-prem Exchange servers  using a combination of additional critical CVEs to obtain complete control of the targeted endpoint.</p><h4 id=\"finding-exchange-servers-in-the-wild\">Finding Exchange servers in the wild</h4><p>Discovering servers that belong to the Exchange Web Services family could be as easy as taking advantage of a well-known configuration artifact or feature: the <strong>Autodiscover</strong> protocol. Introduced as part of Exchange 2016, its purpose is to assist email applications in locating Exchange servers with minimal user interaction, whether inside or outside firewalls, while automatically setting any corresponding user profile.</p><p>Last year, however, when user credentials began randomly reaching domains such as <em>autodiscover[.]com</em> or <em>autodiscover[.]online</em>, a massive credential leak problem ensued. As a result, organizations were advised to start blocking autodiscover TLDs at the perimeter level as a stopgap measure; and yet, by late August, researchers had managed to obtain over 370,000 Windows domain credentials through the faulty back-off mechanism.</p><p>Part of what makes finding web-based Exchange infrastructure so appealing to attackers is the technologys close-knit integration with Internet Information Services (IIS). Historically, IIS  the extensible web server platform known as ground zero for a number of unspecified vulnerabilities  has been linked to a series of <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/07/26/malicious-iis-extensions-quietly-open-persistent-backdoors-into-servers\">malicious extensions</a> that can act as a persistence mechanism, providing a highly covert channel with low detection rates. More recently, in one sobering case termed Owowa, this IIS backdoor allowed for the passive collection and siphoning of OWA (Outlook Web Access) credentials from unsuspecting visitors trying to authenticate to the web portal.</p><p>Besides the described Autodiscover scenarios via TLDs, discovering Exchange endpoints can be accomplished using <a href=\"https://github.com/righel/ms-exchange-version-nse\">Nmap scripts</a> (or NSEs). Fundamentally, this is no different from any other scanning method that relies on JSON input files, or some other format, for <a href=\"https://github.com/righel/ms-exchange-version-nse/blob/main/ms-exchange-versions-dict.json\">versioning</a> purposes. We can use a similar approach to detect any potential CVEs using build names and release dates.</p><p><img alt=\"discovering_exchange_servers_figure_2.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/discovering_exchange_servers_figure_2_39c2f981f8.png\" /></p><p>Search engines like Shodan or Wappalyzer can also help locate Exchange-related technologies. Once again, of particular interest are instances of Outlook Web App  in this case, with results upwards of 200K (see below), an HTTP response header value called X-OWA-Version is leveraged to pull versioning information.</p><p><img alt=\"discovering_exchange_servers_figure_3.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/discovering_exchange_servers_figure_3_f2c9b9557d.png\" /></p><p><img alt=\"discovering_exchange_servers_figure_4.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/discovering_exchange_servers_figure_4_9f74ff483e.png\" /></p><h4 id=\"enter-attack-surface-intelligence\">Enter Attack Surface Intelligence</h4><p>The barrier to conducting timely risk assessments using any of the above contingencies has been significantly lowered by platforms like <strong><a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/corp/attack-surface-intelligence\">Attack Surface Intelligence</a></strong>. And thats because this new paradigm, by its very makeup, is designed to combine every pertinent element for visibility purposes.</p><p>In a recent <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/blog/zero-day-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities\">analysis</a> detailing two of Exchanges latest CVEs, we established how our <em>Attack Surface Intelligence Module</em> can lead you in the speedy discovery of any public-facing Exchange infrastructure; if youre a client with access to this feature, youll only be a few clicks away from doing so.</p><p><img alt=\"discovering_exchange_servers_exchange_results.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/discovering_exchange_servers_exchange_results_692b473ac9.png\" /></p><p>Another worth mentioning alternative includes the use of domain-specific tools like our very own <em><a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/support/knowledge-base/sql-explorer\">SQL Explorer</a></em>, which extends the discovery space far beyond the graphical user interface. Lets illustrate the latter using two sample SQL queries:</p><p><img alt=\"discovering_exchange_servers_figure_6.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/discovering_exchange_servers_figure_6_3492e682e5.png\" /></p><p>In the above query, were interested in one thing: what domains may indicate email presence in the form of either Exchange or Outlook as part of the sites <em>title</em>. The idea here is a rather simple one as well: sites that advertise page titles such as these are prone to be hosting some sort of Exchange-like technology; however, the results are by no means definitive, as both terms can easily be found outside the purview of mail services.</p><p>An improved query looks as follows inside the SQL Explorer interface:</p><p><img alt=\"discovering_exchange_servers_figure_7.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/discovering_exchange_servers_figure_7_f685bae66a.png\" /></p><p>Here, the focus shifts entirely in favor of <em>tags</em>  a handy feature that pivots on our vast data collection to identify assets speedily. Soon after, the results look much more promising than before, as the hostname portion now shows:</p><p><img alt=\"discovering_exchange_servers_sql_results.png\" src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/discovering_exchange_servers_sql_results_d0efbef376.png\" /></p><h4 id=\"summing-up\">Summing up</h4><p>Unparalleled visibility, real-time asset monitoring, and proactive vulnerability mapping; these are some of the net positives that Attack Surface Intelligence can afford modern organizations <strong>today</strong>.</p><p>If you find yourself, or your IT staff, plodding through your daily workload just to keep things under control, think again. As hinted in this article, think about the possibility of having unmanaged Exchange infrastructure lurking in your precious inventory. Proper knowledge of these proverbial crown jewels isnt only good governance, its good risk management: the penalties of losing valuable employee and/or customer data as a consequence of such an oversight can be long-lasting and severe.</p><p>Under the hood, it may be tempting to devote a handful of resources here and there to manually locate these endpoints, given the open-source nature of some of the tools and applications involved, and remediate any issues if need be. But in reality, youll be risking missing critical assets as you try to consistently enumerate your constantly evolving digital workforce  a seemingly impossible task if you ask me.</p><p>Until next time...</p><p> <strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uGpjw3\">Schedule your Attack Surface Intelligence Demo</a></strong></p>"}], "tags": [{"term": "Blog", "scheme": null, "label": null}]}]}
