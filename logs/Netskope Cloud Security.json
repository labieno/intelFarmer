Abusing free cloud services, especially services that provide free web hosting or free object hosting, is a <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/netskope-threat-labs-stats-for-january-2023\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">common technique</a> used by attackers to host malicious content. This blog post provides a summary of what these scams and phishing pages look like, along with recommendations and threat intel you can use to protect yourself and your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech Support Scam</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>How it Works</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This scam works by mimicking Windows Defender alerts, luring victims into believing that their computer is infected with malware. The goal of this attack is to convince the victim to call the scammer\u2019s phone number. Attackers may attempt to remotely access the victim&#8217;s computer to either install malware or request payment for a service to fix the bogus infection. Attackers typically use <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2022/09/microsoft-edges-news-feed-pushes-tech-support-scam\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">malvertising</a> to redirect victims to these scam pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50417\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-2-1024x679.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Tech scam attack, using a fake number as an example.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the victim interacts with the webpage, the web browser\u2019s window is maximized and an audio starts playing with the following message:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>\u201cImportant security message.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Your computer has been locked up.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Your IP address was used without your knowledge or consent to visit websites that contain identity theft virus.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>To unlock the computer, please call support immediately.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Please, do not attempt to shutdown or restart your computer. Doing that may lead to data loss and identity theft.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The computer lock is aimed to stop illegal activity.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Please, call our support immediately.\u201d</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all attempts to scare victims and force them to call the attacker\u2019s phone number. The campaigns Netskope Threat Labs has identified all use&nbsp; different \u201cthemes\u201d, but rely on the same technique. For example, below is an example that shows a fake Windows desktop in the background and a fake webchat, which eventually displays a message saying that there\u2019s an error and asks the victim to contact the phone number instead of the chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50418\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-3-1024x674.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Another example of the same tech scam.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We also found pages in different languages such as Japanese, showing that this is a multilingual campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50422\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-4-1024x801.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Same tech support scam in Japanese.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>How is it spread across DigitalOcean?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DigitalOcean allows users to host up to three static <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">websites for free</a>. Since the phone number displayed on the tech scam page is dynamic and can be changed via the \u201cphone\u201d parameter in the URL, attackers can use different phone numbers in the same DigitalOcean instance, without changing anything in the HTML or the scripts. This also means that attackers can create multiple DigitalOcean instances and replicate the same HTML and script files, as these do not require any changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the example below, we used fake numbers to illustrate how this works.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50424\" height=\"697\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-5.png\" width=\"872\" /><figcaption>Example of how attackers can use different phone numbers through the same HTML and different DigitalOcean instances.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This can also be confirmed by checking VirusTotal. For example, <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c6de2b89cd507131d75bb89cf94a719466c19f5d8565af52376d3f6c9880f7e7/detection\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of the pages</a> we analyzed is related to 87 different domains from DigitalOcean.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50426\" height=\"590\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-6-1024x590.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>DigitalOcean domains related to one of the tech support scam pages.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Netskope Threat Labs has been tracking attackers abusing DigitalOcean in these campaigns, there are also recent reports of similar scams where attackers are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1628309680450678786\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">abusing Microsoft Azure</a> to host the pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Phishing Pages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Netskope Threat Labs is also tracking an increase in phishing activity hosted on DigitalOcean, focused primarily on stealing sensitive financial data, like credit card and debit card numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>America First Credit Union</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the targets is America First Credit Union, where attackers created a very similar phishing page compared to the original website. Although the page looks very similar, one can easily distinguish between the original website by checking the URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50430\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-7-1024x418.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Phishing page hosted on DigitalOcean vs. the original website.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the victim adds the login information, the attackers attempt to steal more personal information like the victim\u2019s full name, date of birth, social security number, carrier pin, and the address.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50435\" height=\"795\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-8.png\" width=\"403\" /><figcaption>Phishing page asking for more information.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After entering all the data above, the page then asks for the victim\u2019s debit card number, expiration date, CVV, and the card pin.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50437\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-9.png\" width=\"406\" /><figcaption>Phishing page asking for credit card information.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the phishing page attempts to steal the victim\u2019s email address and password. This is done by simulating a third-party login after inserting the email address in the phishing page. Attackers try to take over the victim&#8217;s email in order to gain control over the account&#8217;s MFA, if enabled. The access to the victim&#8217;s email also allows attackers to attempt to reset passwords and gain access to other accounts that are linked to the same email address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an extra attempt to deceive the victim, the phishing page tries to simulate the login page according to the email address provided by the user. For example, if a Gmail account is detected, the phishing page simulates Google\u2019s login page.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50419\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Abusing-DIgitalOcean-10-1024x562.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Phishing page trying to steal the

/><figcaption>Phishing page simulating Microsoft\u2019s email login.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If the email provided by the victim is not from a known service, the phishing page uses the same layout as the one used for Gmail, but without Google\u2019s logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50421\"

website.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Huntington National Bank</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second target is Huntington National Bank, where the attack flow is similar to the America First\u2019s phishing page.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50425\" height=\"788\"

This latest set of tech support scams and phishing pages are noteworthy because of the focused abuse of DigitalOcean and the success in reaching their victims, resulting in a 17-fold increase in blocking malicious content hosted on DigitalOcean in the Netskope platform. Netskope Threat Labs has been reporting the URLs to the targeted institutions and to DigitalOcean as they are discovered. Although DigitalOcean is promptly taking down the sites, attackers have been responding by continuing to create new ones. Netskope Threat Labs will continue to track and respond to this set of campaigns as they continue and evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The scams and phishing pages described in the post are easily recognisable by the URL, as the attacker has made little effort to disguise the URL. Users can easily avoid becoming victims of the types of attacks described in this post by simply checking the URL and making sure it is the legitimate website. Users should access important pages like their banking portal or webmail by&nbsp; typing the URL directly in the web browser instead of using search engines or any other links, as the results could be manipulated by SEO techniques or malicious ads. We strongly recommend immediately closing web pages that say your computer is infected and also never calling the number on the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, Netskope Threat Labs recommends that organizations review their security policies to ensure that they are adequately protected against these and similar phishing pages and scams::</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Inspect all HTTP and HTTPs traffic, including all web and cloud traffic, to prevent users from visiting malicious websites. Netskope customers can configure their <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/products/next-gen-swg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netskope NG-SWG</a> with a URL filtering policy to block known phishing and scam sites, and a threat protection policy to inspect all web content to identify unknown phishing and scam sites using a combination of signatures, threat intelligence, and machine learning.</li><li>Use&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/products/remote-browser-isolation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)</a> technology to provide additional protection when there is a need to visit websites that fall in categories that can present higher risk, like Newly Observed and Newly Registered Domains.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Protection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Netskope Threat Labs is actively monitoring this campaign and has ensured coverage for all known threat indicators and payloads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Netskope Threat Protection</strong><ul><li>Document-HTML.Trojan.TechScam</li><li>Document-HTML.Trojan.Cryxos</li></ul></li><li><strong>Netskope Advanced

trend.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular what makes this campaign stand out is the abuse of multiple cloud services in different stages of the kill chain in an attempt to evade detection by making malicious traffic look legitimate, making life harder for defenders. <strong>Dropbox</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> are exploited to host and distribute the malware payload (Microsoft Azure is also abused to exfiltrate data), whereas the command and control infrastructure relies on two additional cloud services, <strong>Microsoft 365 Mail</strong> and <strong>Google Firebase</strong>. In practice, the campaign is based exclusively on the weaponization of legitimate cloud services. Personally this is the first time I\u2019ve seen four different cloud services exploited in the same campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial attack vector involves the delivery of targeted WhatsApp messages containing Dropbox links to archive files that supposedly contain documents on poverty issues in the Middle East, as well as a malware loader masquerading as the<a href=\"https://pdf.wondershare.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> PDFelement</a> application. There are two elements in this modus operandi that are normally leveraged by threat actors: it\u2019s easier to trick the victims by delivering the malicious links on a mobile device, and, despite all the warnings, users tend to install applications from any origin, without checking the legitimacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The malware loader deploys a backdoor called CMD365, which executes commands from a Microsoft 365 Mail instance using the Microsoft Graph API (a technique used in several <a href=\"https://blog.cluster25.duskrise.com/2022/09/23/in-the-footsteps-of-the-fancy-bear-powerpoint-graphite/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cyber espionage campaigns</a>) and exfiltrates data to a Microsoft Azure instance. Among the malware deployed on compromised machines, there is also an additional sample called CMDEmber, which uses Google Firebase<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database\"> </a>as the command and control server.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-netskope-mitigates-the-risk-of-legitimate-cloud-services-exploited-to-deliver-malware\"><strong>How Netskope mitigates the risk of legitimate cloud services exploited to deliver malware</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropbox, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Office 365 Suite (where Microsoft 365 Mail belongs), and Google Firebase are among the thousands of services where the Netskope <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/products/next-gen-swg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Next Gen SWG</a> can provide granular access control, threat protection, and DLP capabilities.

Physical warfare between Ukraine and Russia has been accompanied by cyberwarfare between the two countries. This blog post focuses on cyberwar, particularly what we can learn from the past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-observations\">Observations</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Attacks primarily target government agencies and critical infrastructure</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of Russian attacks over the past year targeted military and <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/new-formbook-campaign-delivered-through-phishing-emails\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">government agencies</a> and critical infrastructure, especially <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/405538\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">telecommunications providers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sandworm-hackers-fail-to-take-down-ukrainian-energy-provider/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">energy companies</a>. Other attacks were more broadly targeted at companies and individuals in Ukraine and their allies throughout the world. Meanwhile, the majority of Ukrainian attacks were targeted at Russian government institutions, with attacks focused on <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-s-it-army-is-disrupting-russias-alcohol-distribution/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taking down Russian websites</a>, <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/russian-ministry-website/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disrupting financial services</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ukraine-shutters-two-more-russian/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disrupting misinformation campaigns</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Phishing is the primary infiltration technique used for the majority of attacks</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common infiltration technique used in the cyberwar has been <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/new-formbook-campaign-delivered-through-phishing-emails\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">phishing</a>, with both sides using targeted spear phishing campaigns, often <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-govt-hackers-hit-ukraine-with-cobalt-strike-credomap-malware/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accompanied by file-based exploits</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-sandworm-hackers-pose-as-ukrainian-telcos-to-drop-malware/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">other malicious payloads</a>. Phishing is popular in cyberwar because it is simple, low-risk, effective, and versatile. A well-crafted and targeted phishing message delivered via <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-russian-armageddon-phishing-targets-eu-govt-agencies/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">messaging app</a>, SMS, email, social media, or another channel can be used against practically any type of target. After a successful phish, attacks typically focus on espionage or sabotage.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Espionage and sabotage are the primary objectives</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In cyberwar, espionage and sabotage are the primary objectives. In the past year, espionage has typically taken the form of <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/romcom-hackers-circulating-malicious.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RATs</a> and <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/134438/apt/gamaredon-continues-target-ukraine.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">infostealers</a>, while sabotage has typically taken the form of <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-s-largest-isp-says-2022-broke-all-ddos-attack-records/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DDoS attacks</a>, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/russia-based-ransomboggs-ransomware.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ransomware</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-caddywiper-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukrainian-networks/\">wipers</a>. Throughout the year, many Russian wipers emerged to target Ukraine, including <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/netskope-threat-coverage-whispergate\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WhisperGate, </a><a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/netskope-threat-coverage-hermeticwiper\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HermeticWiper</a>, <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IsaacWiper</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/02/24/year-wiper-attacks-ukraine/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">others</a>. One recent ransomware attack used a new ransomware family, <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/resources/reports-guides/threat-labs-report-october-2022\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prestige</a>, to target logistics and transportation sectors in Ukraine and Poland.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>15% of attacks target other nations, primarily allies</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While approximately 85% of attacks have been targeted at individuals or organizations within Russia or Ukraine, the remaining 15% have been <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-russia-stepped-up-cyberattacks-against-ukraine-s-allies/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">targeted primarily at allies throughout the world</a>. Like the attacks within Russia and Ukraine, attacks on targets in other nations have also targeted <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/10/1051973/russia-hack-viasat-satellite-ukraine-invasion/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">critical infrastructure</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-russian-armageddon-phishing-targets-eu-govt-agencies/\">government agencies</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant breakout attack of the Russo-Ukrainian war happened in 2017 with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petya_and_NotPetya\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NotPetya</a>, a Russian wiper targeted at Ukraine that ended up infecting systems throughout the world, including companies Maersk and Merck, and causing an estimated $10 billion in damages. In the year since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have yet to see a breakout attack of that scale. So far, attacks outside of Russia and Ukraine have been seemingly well-targeted. Some attacks, notably the early attack against <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/10/1051973/russia-hack-viasat-satellite-ukraine-invasion/\">Viasat</a>, were less precisely targeted. While intended to interrupt network connectivity in Ukraine, the Viasat attack caused outages across Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-lessons\">Lessons</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Anti-phishing controls and training are essential defenses during a cyberwar. Interrupting phishing attempts can help stop a cyberattack before it can cause any damage.</li><li>Government agencies and critical infrastructure are at the greatest risk during a cyberwar, warranting extra investment in cybersecurity defenses and the establishment of stricter cybersecurity controls to reduce risk surface.</li><li>Ransomware defenses, especially robust and well-tested backups, can also be effective defenses against some destructive wipers typically used during cyberwar.</li><li>The closer an individual or organization is to the conflict, either physically or through alliance, the more likely they are to be targeted.

The purpose of this post is to provide strategic, actionable intelligence on active threats against enterprise users worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h-summary\">Summary</h1>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Attackers continue to attempt to fly under the radar by using cloud apps to deliver malware, with 54% of all malware downloads in January originating from 142 cloud apps.</li><li>ZIP files are gaining popularity among attackers who use the archive format to try to evade defenses and avoid suspicion. 21% of all malware downloads in January were ZIP files.</li><li>Trojans continue to represent the majority of malware downloads, used to deliver payloads such as the infostealer AgentTesla and the ransomware Vice Society.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h-cloud-malware-delivery\">Cloud Malware Delivery</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers attempt to fly under the radar by delivering malicious content via popular cloud apps. Abusing cloud apps for malware delivery enables attackers to evade security controls that rely primarily on domain block lists and URL filtering, or that do not inspect cloud traffic. In January 2023, 54% of all HTTP/HTTPS malware downloads originated from popular cloud apps, increasing for the third consecutive month and reaching the highest levels in the past six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50263\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Threat-Stats-1-1024x620.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The increase in cloud malware downloads is driven partially by an increase in the number of distinct cloud apps from which malware are being downloaded. In January 2023, Netskope detected malware downloads from 142 cloud apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50264\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Threat-Stats-2-1024x613.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers enjoy the most success reaching enterprise users when they abuse cloud apps that are already popular in the enterprise. Microsoft OneDrive, the most popular enterprise cloud app, has held the top spot for the most cloud malware downloads for more than six months. The other top apps for malware downloads include free web hosting services (Weebly), cloud storage apps (Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive), collaboration apps (Sharepoint), webmail apps (Google Gmail, Outlook.com), and free software hosting sites (GitHub, SourceForge).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 78% of cloud malware downloads, the top eight apps accounted for more malware downloads in January than they had anytime in the previous six months. A relative increase in malware downloads from Amazon S3 propelled it into the top five for only the second time in the past six months, while the remaining top apps remained relatively unchanged. The top ten list is a reflection of attacker tactics, user behavior, and company policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50265\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Threat-Stats-3-1024x552.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50266\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Threat-Stats-4-1024x698.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h1>Top Malware File Types</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>By file type, Microsoft Windows Portable Executable files (EXE/DLL) accounted for the plurality of malware downloads in January, as they have for at least the past six months. Delivering malware in archive files, particularly ZIP files, has been gradually increasing and hit a six-month high in January at 21%, as attackers attempt to evade detection by hiding malware in ZIP files. PDF files have been exhibiting the opposite trend, gradually decreasing and hitting a six-month low in January. The popularity of other file types remains largely unchanged, as attackers continue to use a wide variety of file types to target their victims.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50267\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Threat-Stats-5-1024x410.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50268\" height=\"493\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Threat-Stats-6-1024x493.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h1>Top Malware Families</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers are constantly creating new malware families and new variants of existing families, either as an attempt to bypass security solutions or to update their malware\u2019s capabilities. In January 2023, 58% of all malware downloads detected by Netskope were either new families or new variants that had not been observed in the preceding six months. The other 42% were samples that had been observed during the preceding six months and are still circulating in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By volume, Netskope blocks more Trojans than any other malware type. Trojans are commonly used by attackers to gain an initial foothold and to deliver other types of malware, such as infostealers, remote access trojans, backdoors, and ransomware. Other top malware types include phishing lures (typically PDF files designed to lure victims into phishing scams), viruses that can self-propagate, downloaders that deliver additional payloads, and infostealers whose primary purpose is stealing information (especially passwords, tokens, and cookies).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50269\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Threat-Stats-7-1024x413.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The following list contains the top malware and ransomware families blocked by Netskope in January 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Backdoor.Zusy</strong> (a.k.a.

Two strategies that attackers have been using increasingly in the past six months are to deliver malware by abusing cloud apps and to package malware in ZIP files. Netskope Threat Labs recommends that you review your security posture to ensure that you are adequately protected against both of these trends:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Inspect all HTTP and HTTPs downloads, including all web and cloud traffic, to prevent malware from infiltrating your network. Netskope customers can configure their <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/products/next-gen-swg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netskope NG-SWG</a> with a Threat Protection policy that applies to downloads from all categories and applies to all file types.</li><li>Ensure that your security controls recursively inspect the content of popular archive files such as ZIP files for malicious content. <a href=\"https://docs.netskope.com/en/advanced-threat-protection-86194.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netskope Advanced Threat Protection</a> recursively inspects the content of archives, including ISO, TAR, RAR, 7Z, and ZIP.</li><li>Ensure that high-risk file types like executables and archives are thoroughly inspected using a combination of static and dynamic analysis before being downloaded<strong>. </strong><a href=\"https://docs.netskope.com/en/advanced-threat-protection-86194.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netskope Advanced Threat Protection</a> customers can use a <a href=\"https://docs.netskope.com/en/creating-a-threat-protection-policy-for-patient-zero.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Patient Zero Prevention Policy</a> to hold downloads until they have been fully inspected.</li><li>Configure policies to block downloads from apps that are not used in your organization to reduce your risk surface to only those apps and instances that are necessary for the business.</li><li>Block downloads of all risky file types from newly registered domains and newly observed domains.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to recommendations above, <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/products/remote-browser-isolation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)</a> technology can provide additional protection when there is a need to visit websites that fall in categories that can present higher risk, like Newly Observed and Newly Registered Domains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>About This Report</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Netskope provides threat and data protection to millions of users worldwide.

Initial access brokers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to get hold of valid access credentials (typically VPN or RDP) and outsource or sell them to criminal gangs, including ransomware operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between H2 2021 and H1 2022, the researchers detected 2,348 instances of corporate access put up for sale. This is approximately twice as much as during the previous period (1,099 access offers), for a total size of the market for selling access to corporate networks on the dark web of nearly $6.6M (down from the $7.2M of the previous period H2 2020-H1 2021). This is a decrease in consequence of both a wider offer (not a good sign) and a drop in the average price of a compromised access, about $2,800, which is more than half of the average price during the previous year ($6,500).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analysis of the access types provides additional insights: overall, 70% of those put up for sale were RDP and VPN accounts (a result in line with the previous year.) Access to Citrix, various web panels (CMS, cloud solutions, etc.), and web shells on compromised servers were less common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, such a widespread availability of compromised credentials had an impact even on the techniques used by ransomware operators (the main customers of IABs) to gain the initial access. External remote access services, especially RDP and VPNs, were extensively used by ransomware affiliates, together with the exploitation of public-facing applications, and ahead of \u201cmore traditional\u201d attack vectors such as phishing and <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">drive-by compromise</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mitigating the risk of vulnerable access services and public-facing applications</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/products/private-access\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netskope Private Access</a> allows you to publish resources in a simple and secure manner, providing a Zero Trust alternative to legacy VPNs and remote access technologies, and preventing the direct exposure of services like RDP or SSH. It is possible to publish and segment virtually any application located in a local data center, as well as in a private or public cloud, without opening any inbound service that can be probed by threat actors, such as initial access brokers. There is no need for any on-prem hardware device to install, patch, and maintain, which avoids scalability issues and performance bottlenecks. Finally, a check on the security posture of the endpoint is enforced before accessing the target application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A specific dashboard of<a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/products/advanced-analytics\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Netskope Advanced Analytics</a> allows real-time monitoring of the app utilization, providing actionable insights about user activity and which apps are the most accessed (and exposed), hence supporting the operation team to identify anomalies and maintain the security posture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay Safe!</p>\n</div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/netskope-cloud-threats-memo-learnings-from-the-hi-tech-crime-trends-2022-2023\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netskope Cloud Threats Memo: Learnings From the Hi-Tech Crime Trends 2022/2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netskope</a>.</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/netskope-cloud-threats-memo-learnings-from-the-hi-tech-crime-trends-2022-2023/feed", "slash_comments": "0"}, {"title": "Threat Labs News Roundup: January 2023", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/category/netskope-threat-labs/feed", "value": "Threat Labs News Roundup: January 2023"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/threat-labs-news-roundup-january-2023"}, {"type": "image/png", "href": "https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023-02-Threat-Labs-News-Roundup_-January-2023-social-1200x627-1.png", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/threat-labs-news-roundup-january-2023", "comments": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/threat-labs-news-roundup-january-2023#respond", "published": "Thu, 16 Feb 2023 16:01:26 +0000", "published_parsed": [2023, 2, 16, 16, 1, 26, 3, 47, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Gustavo Palazolo"}], "author": "Gustavo Palazolo", "author_detail": {"name": "Gustavo Palazolo"}, "tags": [{"term": "Threat Labs", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "id": "https://www.netskope.com/?p=50247", "guidislink": false, "summary": "<p>Summary The purpose of the Netskope Threat Labs \u201cCybersecurity News Roundup\u201d series is to provide enterprise security teams an actionable brief on the top cybersecurity news from around the world.

These activities include: reading emails, sending emails on behalf of the victim itself, reading the calendar, changing profile and email settings, and many others permissions that can be exploited to steal confidential information from the target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The so-called user experience is similar to a traditional phishing attack. The victim receives a malicious link, for example via a spear phishing email, but instead of being presented with a form mimicking a legitimate app eager to steal their credentials, they are presented with an authentication page where a seemingly legitimate cloud app asks to access their cloud environment with specific permissions on behalf of the user, permissions that the victims do not double check and end up delivering attackers the keys of the kingdom Multi-factor authentication does not help to mitigate this attack, since the user must authenticate to the target app to provide consent to the malicious application. Then once the authorization token is issued, the only way to remediate is to delete the malicious app from the target environment or, in other terms, revoke the token.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50122\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CTM-2-2-1024x488.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Example of an OAuth phishing page allowing the consent to manage emails and contacts</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Threat actors have been exploiting this technique since at least 2017 for both opportunistic and targeted campaigns: <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APT 28</a> (also known as <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/d/pawn-storm-abuses-open-authentication-advanced-social-engineering-attacks.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pawn Storm</a>) is the first known example of a state-sponsored threat actor exploiting OAuth phishing since 2017. But the risks of this attack were almost completely unknown to the wider audience, until May 3rd of the same year, when a massive <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/google-doc-cloudphishing-worm-attack-technical-analysis\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OAuth worm</a> hit more than one million Google Workspace users (and yes, it was called G Suite back then).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, there have been <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-attack-hijacks-office-365-accounts-using-oauth-apps/\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-warns-of-increasing-oauth-office-365-phishing-attacks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">examples</a> of campaigns carried out via OAuth phishing, and the risks connected with third-party application access to corporate data are a reality, and will also be the topic of a <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/netskope-threat-labs#events\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a> of our Netskope Threat Labs at the forthcoming RSA Conference by our top-rated speaker <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/author/jenkohwong\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jenko Hwong</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest occurrence, Microsoft and Proofpoint have just <a href=\"https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2023/01/31/threat-actor-consent-phishing-campaign-abusing-the-verified-publisher-process/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taken down</a> a network of fraudulent, verified Microsoft Partner Network accounts exploited to create malicious OAuth applications with the purpose to infiltrate the cloud environments of corporate users in the UK and Ireland and steal sensitive information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campaign occurred between December 6 and December 27, 2022, and the threat actors impersonated credible publishers to become verified themselves, and provide even better legitimacy to the malicious OAuth apps. According to Microsoft, the rogue apps were used to steal customers&#8217; emails, but according to Proofpoint, the reality is unsurprisingly worse since the app&#8217;s permissions could have allowed the attackers to access calendars and meeting information and modify user permissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-netskope-mitigates-the-risk-of-consent-phishing\"><strong>How Netskope mitigates the risk of consent phishing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/products/saas-security-posture-management\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netskope SSPM</a> (SaaS Security Posture Management) continuously monitors and enforces SaaS security settings, policies, and best practices to reduce security and compliance risks, helping organizations to detect rogue applications with harmful permissions and enforce the corresponding remediation actions. Among the <a href=\"https://docs.netskope.com/iaas_out/office365_out.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">entities</a> that can be monitored for a Microsoft 365 environment, there are also the OAuth permission grants to third-party apps (entity OAuth2PermissionGrant), so that organizations can be alerted if an OAuth app obtains permissions considered harmful and too intrusive. As noted earlier, once a user falls into the trap of OAuth phishing, the only possibility is to revoke the authorization token and remove the application, and Netskope SSPM can certainly identify malicious OAuth apps and provide the organization with actionable information to remediate the threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example a rule that verifies that the OAuth permissions granted to third-party apps will not modify app role assignments, is part of the predefined profiles:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CSA-CCM-4.0&#8211; CSA Cloud Controls Matrix</li><li>GDPR-2016-679&#8211; General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679</li><li>HIPAA-1996&#8211; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996</li><li>ISO-27002-2013&#8211; ISO/IEC 27002:2013</li><li>NIST-CSF-1.1&#8211; NIST Cybersecurity Framework</li><li>NIST-800-53-4&#8211; NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4</li><li>PCI-DSS-3.0&#8211; PCI Data Security Standard v3.0</li><li>AICPA-SOC-TSC-2017&#8211; AICPA SOC2 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However it is also possible to create <a href=\"https://docs.netskope.com/en/custom-rules-using-domain-specific-language-305074.html#UUID-68273209-c5df-8240-0fd0-c350ddb3b965_section-idm43237641954316\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">custom rules</a> that check for specific <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scopes</a> considered harmful or non-compliant with the internal policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay safe!</p>\n</div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/cloud-threats-memo-understanding-the-growing-risk-of-consent-phishing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloud Threats Memo: Understanding the Growing Risk of Consent Phishing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netskope</a>.</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/cloud-threats-memo-understanding-the-growing-risk-of-consent-phishing/feed", "slash_comments": "0"}, {"title": "ChatGPT: Dispelling FUD, Driving Awareness About Real Threats", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/category/netskope-threat-labs/feed", "value": "ChatGPT: Dispelling FUD, Driving Awareness About Real Threats"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/chatgpt-dispelling-fud-driving-awareness-about-real-threats"}, {"type": "image/png", "href": "https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-ChatGPT_-Dispelling-FUD-Driving-Awareness-About-Real-Threats-social-1200x627-1.png", "rel": "enclosure"}], "link": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/chatgpt-dispelling-fud-driving-awareness-about-real-threats", "comments": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/chatgpt-dispelling-fud-driving-awareness-about-real-threats#respond", "published": "Fri, 20 Jan 2023 15:00:00 +0000", "published_parsed": [2023, 1, 20, 15, 0, 0, 4, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Gustavo Palazolo"}], "author": "Gustavo Palazolo", "author_detail": {"name": "Gustavo Palazolo"}, "tags": [{"term": "Threat Labs", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "id": "https://www.netskope.com/?p=49871", "guidislink": false, "summary": "<p>Summary ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot created by OpenAI, reaching 1 million users at the end of 2022.

Due to its flexibility and ability to mimic human behavior, ChatGPT has raised concerns in several areas, including cybersecurity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its popularity has grown specially because it provides fluent responses to questions about virtually any subject, including history, math, literature, and technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49872\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-1.png\" width=\"729\" /><figcaption><em>Asking ChatGPT what is its purpose.</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The chatbot is also a great tool for developers, able to create, review, improve, and explain code in multiple languages, such as C++, Java, Python, Go, and Rust. It also provides an <a href=\"https://openai.com/api/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">API</a> that can be used by plugins in different platforms such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and IDEs like <a href=\"https://github.com/mpociot/chatgpt-vscode\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">VS Code</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what happens if someone asks ChatGPT to create malware or ransomware? No need to panic right now, as ChatGPT will not create novel, functional malware automatically. But it can still be abused by attackers to improve social engineering skills or to understand and build common malware components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For social engineering, it can generate novel, fluent bait messages. For malware, it can serve as an interactive interface into the many malware tutorials and examples that already exist on the internet, but it still requires a certain knowledge from the person to use this tool to create a functional malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also good news for cybersecurity defenders. ChatGPT has also been trained on examples of common code vulnerabilities and can pick them out when you share the source code with ChatGPT. So, like many inventions, ChatGPT can be used for both good and evil. Here\u2019s a closer look at how:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-malware-development\">Malware Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Can ChatGPT automatically create novel, functional malware? The short answer is no, but, the tool can be used by attackers to aid in the malware development process, especially by those without experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first use case is to use it to learn and get code examples about malicious techniques. For example, we asked ChatGPT to explain details about a common process injection technique named <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Process Hollowing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49873\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-2.png\" width=\"808\" /><figcaption><em>ChatGPT explaining what Process Hollowing is.</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer was quite precise and included an example in C++, which could be easily modified to embed this functionality to a malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked more questions about specific techniques that could be incorporated into malware, such as downloading and executing files from remote URLs or how to encrypt a file using AES on Windows, and the chatbot was able to generate and explain all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49874\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-3.png\" width=\"795\" /><figcaption>ChatGPT showing a C++ code that encrypts a file using AES</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, during our tests, we found that ChatGPT generated incomplete codes for questions that add a certain level of complexity. For example, the AI wasn\u2019t able to provide us with the entire code for a program that searches for files on Windows and encrypts them using a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, which is a behavior that could be used to create ransomware.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49878\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-4.png\" width=\"682\" /><figcaption>Incomplete code generated by ChatGPT.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI is also able to identify malicious intent depending on how the question is asked. For example, we failed in obtaining a single code that downloads a base64 encoded executable and executes it using process hollowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49879\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-5.png\" width=\"726\" /><figcaption>ChatGPT telling us that it cannot create the code we asked for.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But although the code wasn\u2019t generated in a single answer, nothing stops the attacker from splitting the question by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Asking for a code example on how to download base64 encoded files;</li><li>Asking for an example of Process Hollowing technique;</li><li>Combine both answers to perform process injection with the downloaded file.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49880\" height=\"722\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-6.png\" width=\"809\" /><figcaption>Code created by ChatGPT that downloads a base64 encoded file from an external URL.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, ChatGPT won\u2019t create a novel or a complete malware for someone, but it can indeed be used as a resource to study and create snippets of code that when combined could be used to create a functional malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Social Engineering</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers can use ChatGPT to improve their social engineering skills. It can help to write specific texts that would be used on phishing emails, redirecting victims to malicious websites or luring them into downloading attached malware.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we asked ChatGPT to write an email that makes it look like the person just won $100,000 in a lottery named \u201cBigMoney.\u201d We specifically asked ChatGPT to randomly generate the ticket number and to convince the person to open a link that will supposedly claim the prize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The text generated by the AI could be easily employed in phishing emails to redirect people to a website that attempts to steal sensitive information, such as email accounts and passwords.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49881\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-7.png\" width=\"722\" /><figcaption>Email generated by ChatGPT that tells a person won in the lottery.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example is spear phishing. With previous knowledge about the target, an attacker can provide details about the victim to ChatGPT and ask help to generate a text that convinces the person to open an attached file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To exemplify this, we asked ChatGPT to generate an email from a person named Ruth to another person named Glenn, asking help on a fictional project. The project details would be attached in the email, which could be a weaponized file created by the attacker.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49882\" height=\"703\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-8.png\" width=\"727\" /><figcaption>Email generated by ChatGPT that could be used in spear phishing attacks.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers could also abuse ChatGPT to create fake news, luring victims to a website that steals sensitive data, such as email or bank accounts. As an example, we asked the AI to generate an email that contains fake news about the California government providing $5,000 to COVID-19 victims.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49875\" height=\"837\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-9.png\" width=\"727\" /><figcaption>Text generated by ChatGPT that contains fake news to support a phishing email.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These examples demonstrate that ChatGPT has the potential to significantly decrease the barrier of entry for cybercriminals in building their social engineering attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefits for Cybersecurity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT is not only useful for attackers, but it can also be a valuable tool for defenders, who can use the tool to spot vulnerabilities in code or assess security posture to improve defenses overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we shared a piece of Python code with ChatGPT that contains a SQL injection vulnerability, and the AI was able to spot the problem, explain why it happens, and also provided suggestions to fix the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49876\" height=\"752\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-10.png\" width=\"811\" /><figcaption>ChatGPT spotting an SQL injection vulnerability.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, by sharing pieces of code with ChatGPT, users could very easily and unintentionally leak personal or corporate information, which could eventually harm organizations. This is even something that is advised by the platform once an account is created. We do not recommend submitting any confidential code to ChatGPT for analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49877\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-Dispelling-FUD-11.png\" width=\"487\" /><figcaption>ChatGPT advises to not share sensitive information in the conversations.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The availability of an AI tool able to mimic human behavior and provide coding knowledge increases cybersecurity risks for organizations, as it can be used by attackers to enhance social engineering attacks and create components to aid malware development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is common for novices to create new malware by copying existing code instead of writing it from scratch, which at this point is likely a faster path than circumventing ChatGPT\u2019s security measures and having to grab pieces of code that need to be adjusted and combined to create functional malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, new attack vectors and malware families that we may see developed with ChatGPT\u2019s help, or any upcoming AI, can largely be addressed by maintaining an effective security posture. This includes keeping software patched and up-to-date, maintaining effective data protection policies and technologies, and equipping the organization\u2019s most valuable assets with additional security software such as an EDR (endpoint detection and response) and a secure web gateway solution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For social engineering attacks that may emerge with the AI\u2019s help, it\u2019s important for organizations to rebuild the \u2018human firewall\u2019, training employees and customers to spot the small clues, such as misplaced details in phishing emails, and to always verify the identity of the person they are talking to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we demonstrated, ChatGPT is not only a tool that can be used by attackers, but it can also be used in favor of developers and security professionals to spot code vulnerabilities and assess security posture. Also, having a better understanding of how attackers could potentially abuse this tool can help security teams to be better protected. Last but not least, the chatbot is still under development, so we should expect more robust security measures from OpenAI to prevent abuse of the tool.</p>\n</div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/chatgpt-dispelling-fud-driving-awareness-about-real-threats\" rel=\"nofollow\">ChatGPT: Dispelling FUD, Driving Awareness About Real Threats</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netskope</a>.</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://www.netskope.com/blog/chatgpt-dispelling-fud-driving-awareness-about-real-threats/feed", "slash_comments": "0"}]}
