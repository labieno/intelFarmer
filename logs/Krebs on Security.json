Microsoft said it has seen evidence that attackers are exploiting this flaw, which can be done without any user interaction by sending a booby-trapped email that triggers automatically when retrieved by the email server &#8212; <em>before the email is even viewed in the Preview Pane</em>.</p>\n<p>While CVE-2023-23397 is labeled as an &#8220;Elevation of Privilege&#8221; vulnerability, that label doesn\u2019t accurately reflect its severity, said <strong>Kevin Breen</strong>, director of cyber threat research at <strong>Immersive Labs</strong>.</p>\n<p>Known as an NTLM relay attack, it allows an attacker to get someone\u2019s NTLM hash [Windows account password] and use it in an attack commonly referred to as &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pass The Hash</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The vulnerability effectively lets the attacker authenticate as a trusted individual without having to know the person\u2019s password,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;This is on par with an attacker having a valid password with access to an organization\u2019s systems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Security firm <strong>Rapid7</strong> points out that this bug affects self-hosted versions of Outlook like <strong>Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise</strong>, but Microsoft-hosted online services like <strong>Microsoft 365</strong> are <em>not</em> vulnerable.<span id=\"more-63082\"></span></p>\n<p>The other zero-day flaw being actively exploited in the wild &#8212; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-24880\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-24800</a> &#8212; is a &#8220;Security Feature Bypass&#8221; in <strong>Windows SmartScreen</strong>, part of Microsoft&#8217;s slate of endpoint protection tools.</p>\n<p>Patch management vendor <strong>Action1</strong> notes that the exploit for this bug is low in complexity and requires no special privileges. But it does require some user interaction, and can&#8217;t be used to gain access to private information or privileges. However, the flaw can allow other malicious code to run without being detected by SmartScreen reputation checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Dustin Childs</strong>, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro&#8217;s <strong>Zero Day Initiative</strong>, said CVE-2023-24800 allows attackers to create files that would bypass Mark of the Web (MOTW) defenses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Protective measures like SmartScreen and Protected View in Microsoft Office rely on MOTW, so bypassing these makes it easier for threat actors to spread malware via crafted documents and other infected files that would otherwise be stopped by SmartScreen,&#8221; Childs said.</p>\n<p>Seven other vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this week earned its most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; severity label, meaning the updates address security holes that could be exploited to give the attacker full, remote control over a Windows host with little or no interaction from the user.</p>\n<p>Also this week, Adobe released eight patches addressing a whopping 105 security holes across a variety of products, including <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Cold Fusion</strong>, <strong>Experience Manager</strong>, <strong>Dimension</strong>, <strong>Commerce</strong>, <strong>Magento</strong>, <strong>Substance 3D Stager</strong>, <strong>Cloud Desktop Applicatio</strong>n, and <strong>Illustrator</strong>.</p>\n<p>For a more granular rundown on the updates released today, see the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20March%202023%20Patch%20Tuesday/29634\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SANS Internet Storm Center roundup</a>.

The data included the victim&#8217;s Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number, cellphone number, and home address.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Look familiar?\u201d Singh allegedly wrote to the victim. &#8220;You\u2019re gonna comply to me if you don\u2019t want anything negative to happen to your parents. . .

In June 2015, ICANN suspended Freenom&#8217;s ability to create new domain names or initiate inbound transfers of domain names for 90 days.

Establishing the concept of safe harbors allows the industry to mature incrementally, leveling up security best practices in order to retain a liability shield, versus calling for sweeping reform and unrealistic outcomes as previous regulatory attempts have.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>THE MOST ACTIVE, PERSISTENT THREAT</h2>\n<p>In 2012 (approximately three national cyber strategies ago), then director of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) <strong>Keith Alexander</strong> made headlines when he remarked that years of successful cyber espionage campaigns from Chinese state-sponsored hackers represented &#8220;the greatest transfer of wealth in history.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The document released today says the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) &#8220;now presents the broadest, most active, and most persistent threat to both government and private sector networks,&#8221; and says China is &#8220;the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many of the U.S. government&#8217;s efforts to restrain China&#8217;s technology prowess involve ongoing initiatives like the CHIPS Act, a new law signed by President Biden last year that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/business/economy/biden-tech-chips.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sets aside more than $50 billion to expand U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing and research</a> and to make the U.S. less dependent on foreign suppliers; the <a href=\"https://www.ai.gov/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Artificial Intelligence Initiative</a>; and the <a href=\"https://ntia.gov/other-publication/national-strategy-secure-5g-implementation-plan\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Strategy to Secure 5G</a>.</p>\n<p>As the maker of most consumer gizmos with a computer chip inside, China is also the source of an incredible number of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are not only poorly secured, but are probably more accurately described as <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/who-makes-the-iot-things-under-attack/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insecure by design</a>.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration said it would continue its previously announced plans <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity/cybersecurity-labeling-consumers-0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to develop a system of labeling that could be applied to various IoT products</a> and give consumers some idea of how secure the products may be. But it remains unclear how those labels might apply to products made by companies outside of the United States.<span id=\"more-62912\"></span></p>\n<h2>FIGHTING BADNESS IN THE CLOUD</h2>\n<p>One could convincingly make the case that the world has witnessed yet another historic transfer of wealth and trade secrets over the past decade &#8212; in the form of ransomware and data ransom attacks by Russia-based cybercriminal syndicates, as well as Russian intelligence agency operations like <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/solarwinds-breach/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the U.S. government-wide Solar Winds compromise</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-48090\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cloudrain.jpg\" width=\"714\" /></p>\n<p>On the ransomware front, the White House strategy seems to focus heavily on building the capability to disrupt the digital infrastructure used by adversaries that are threatening vital U.S. cyber interests. The document points to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/international-action-targets-emotet-crimeware/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the 2021 takedown of the Emotet botnet</a> &#8212; a cybercrime machine that was heavily used by multiple Russian ransomware groups &#8212; as a model for this activity, but says those disruptive operations need to happen faster and more often.</p>\n<p>To that end, the Biden administration says it will expand the capacity of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Investigative_Joint_Task_Force\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force</a> (NCIJTF), the primary federal agency for coordinating cyber threat investigations across law enforcement agencies, the intelligence community, and the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To increase the volume and speed of these integrated disruption campaigns, the Federal Government must further develop technological and organizational platforms that enable continuous, coordinated operations,&#8221; the strategy observes. &#8220;The NCIJTF will expand its capacity to coordinate takedown and disruption campaigns with greater speed, scale, and frequency. Similarly, DoD and the Intelligence Community are committed to bringing to bear their full range of complementary authorities to disruption campaigns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The strategy anticipates the U.S. government working more closely with cloud and other Internet infrastructure providers to quickly identify malicious use of U.S.-based infrastructure, share reports of malicious use with the government, and make it easier for victims to report abuse of these systems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given the interest of the cybersecurity community and digital infrastructure owners and operators in continuing this approach, we must sustain and expand upon this model so that collaborative disruption operations can be carried out on a continuous basis,&#8221; the strategy argues. &#8220;Threat specific collaboration should take the form of nimble, temporary cells, comprised of a small number of trusted operators, hosted and supported by a relevant hub. Using virtual collaboration platforms, members of the cell would share information bidirectionally and work rapidly to disrupt adversaries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But here, again, there is a carrot-and-stick approach: The administration said it is taking steps to implement <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01714/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Order (EO) 13984</a> &#8211;issued by the Trump administration in January 2021 &#8212; which requires cloud providers to verify the identity of foreign persons using their services.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All service providers must make reasonable attempts to secure the use of their infrastructure against abuse or other criminal behavior,&#8221; the strategy states. &#8220;The Administration will prioritize adoption and enforcement of a risk-based approach to cybersecurity across Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers that addresses known methods and indicators of malicious activity including through implementation of EO 13984.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Ted Schlein</strong>, founding partner of the cybersecurity venture capital firm <a href=\"https://ballisticventures.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ballistic Ventures</a>, said how this gets implemented will determine whether it can be effective.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adversaries know the NSA, which is the elite portion of the nation\u2019s cyber defense, cannot monitor U.S.-based infrastructure, so they just use U.S.-based cloud infrastructure to perpetrate their attacks,&#8221; Schlein said. &#8220;We have to fix this. I believe some of this section is a bit pollyannaish, as it assumes a bad actor with a desire to do a bad thing will self-identify themselves, as the major recommendation here is around KYC (\u2018know your customer\u2019).\u201d</p>\n<h2>INSURING THE INSURERS</h2>\n<p>One brief but interesting section of the strategy titled &#8220;Explore a Federal Cyber Insurance Backdrop&#8221; contemplates the government&#8217;s liability and response to a too-big-to-fail scenario or &#8220;catastrophic cyber incident.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will explore how the government can stabilize insurance markets against catastrophic risk to drive better cybersecurity practices and to provide market certainty when catastrophic events do occur,&#8221; the strategy reads.</p>\n<p>When the Bush administration released the first U.S. national cybersecurity strategy 20 years ago after the 9/11 attacks, the popular term for that same scenario was a &#8220;digital Pearl Harbor,&#8221; and there was a great deal of talk then about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2004/12/08/tougher-cyber-security-measures-urged/486553db-5e09-4bfb-96c1-cd4ab9105724/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">how the cyber insurance market would soon help companies shore up their cybersecurity practices</a>.</p>\n<p>In the wake of countless ransomware intrusions, many companies now hold cybersecurity insurance to help cover the considerable costs of responding to such intrusions. Leaving aside the question of whether insurance coverage has helped companies improve security, what happens if every one of these companies has to make a claim at the same time?</p>\n<p>The notion of a Digital Pearl Harbor incident struck many experts at the time as a hyperbolic justification for expanding the government&#8217;s digital surveillance capabilities, and an overstatement of the capabilities of our adversaries. But back in 2003, most of the world&#8217;s companies didn&#8217;t host their entire business in the cloud.</p>\n<p>Today, nobody questions the capabilities, goals and outcomes of dozens of nation-state level cyber adversaries. And these days, a catastrophic cyber incident could be little more than an extended, simultaneous outage at multiple cloud providers.</p>\n<p>The full national cybersecurity strategy is available from <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the White House website</a> (PDF).</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/highlights-from-the-new-u-s-cybersecurity-strategy/feed/", "slash_comments": "37"}, {"title": "Hackers Claim They Breached T-Mobile More Than 100 Times in 2022", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/", "value": "Hackers Claim They Breached T-Mobile More Than 100 Times in 2022"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/hackers-claim-they-breached-t-mobile-more-than-100-times-in-2022/"}], "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/hackers-claim-they-breached-t-mobile-more-than-100-times-in-2022/", "comments": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/hackers-claim-they-breached-t-mobile-more-than-100-times-in-2022/#comments", "authors": [{"name": "BrianKrebs"}], "author": "BrianKrebs", "author_detail": {"name": "BrianKrebs"}, "published": "Tue, 28 Feb 2023 16:14:57 +0000", "published_parsed": [2023, 2, 28, 16, 14, 57, 1, 59, 0], "tags": [{"term": "A Little Sunshine", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Data Breaches", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "SIM Swapping", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Web Fraud 2.0", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Allison Nixon", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "International Computer Science Institute", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Minecraft", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Nicholas Weaver", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Roblox", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Security Keys", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "SIM swapping", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "T-Mobile", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "tmo up", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Unit 221B", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "id": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=62757", "guidislink": false, "summary": "Three different cybercriminal groups claimed access to internal networks at communications giant T-Mobile in more than 100 separate incidents throughout 2022, new data suggests.

In each case, the goal of the attackers was the same: Phish T-Mobile employees for access to internal company tools, and then convert that access into a cybercrime service that could be hired to divert <em>any</em> T-Mobile user&#8217;s text messages and phone calls to another device.</p>\n<p>The conclusions above are based on an extensive analysis of <strong>Telegram</strong> chat logs from three distinct cybercrime groups or actors that have been identified by security researchers as particularly active in and effective at &#8220;<strong>SIM-swapping</strong>,&#8221; which involves temporarily seizing control over a target&#8217;s mobile phone number.</p>\n<p>Countless websites and online services use SMS text messages for both password resets and multi-factor authentication. This means that stealing someone&#8217;s phone number often can let cybercriminals hijack the target&#8217;s entire digital life in short order &#8212; including access to any financial, email and social media accounts tied to that phone number.</p>\n<p>All three SIM-swapping entities that were tracked for this story remain active in 2023, and they all conduct business in open channels on the instant messaging platform Telegram. KrebsOnSecurity is not naming those channels or groups here because they will simply migrate to more private servers if exposed publicly, and for now those servers remain a useful source of intelligence about their activities.</p>\n<p>Each advertises their claimed access to T-Mobile systems in a similar way. At a minimum, every SIM-swapping opportunity is announced with a brief &#8220;<em>Tmobile up!&#8221;</em> or &#8220;<em>Tmo up!</em>&#8221; message to channel participants. Other information in the announcements includes the price for a single SIM-swap request, and the handle of the person who takes the payment and information about the targeted subscriber.</p>\n<p>The information required from the customer of the SIM-swapping service includes the target&#8217;s phone number, and <a href=\"https://www.hologram.io/blog/whats-an-iccid-number-and-why-does-it-matter-for-cellular-iot/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the serial number</a> tied to the new SIM card that will be used to receive text messages and phone calls from the hijacked phone number.</p>\n<p>Initially, the goal of this project was to count how many times each entity claimed access to T-Mobile throughout 2022, by cataloging the various &#8220;Tmo up!&#8221; posts from each day and working backwards from Dec. 31, 2022.</p>\n<p>But by the time we got to claims made in the middle of May 2022, completing the rest of the year&#8217;s timeline seemed unnecessary. The tally shows that in the last seven-and-a-half months of 2022, these groups collectively made SIM-swapping claims against T-Mobile on 104 separate days &#8212; often with multiple groups claiming access on the same days.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_62908\" style=\"width: 760px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tmodates.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62908\" height=\"497\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tmodates.png\" width=\"750\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-62908\">The 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools.</p></div>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity shared a large amount of data gathered for this story with T-Mobile. The company declined to confirm or deny any of these claimed intrusions. But in a written statement, T-Mobile said this type of activity affects the entire wireless industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And we are constantly working to fight against it,&#8221; the statement reads. &#8220;We have continued to drive enhancements that further protect against unauthorized access, including enhancing multi-factor authentication controls, hardening environments, limiting access to data, apps or services, and more. We are also focused on gathering threat intelligence data, like what you have shared, to help further strengthen these ongoing efforts.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>TMO UP!</h2>\n<p>While it is true that each of these cybercriminal actors periodically offer SIM-swapping services for other mobile phone providers &#8212; including <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Verizon</strong> and smaller carriers &#8212; those solicitations appear <em>far</em> less frequently in these group chats than T-Mobile swap offers. And when those offers do materialize, they are considerably more expensive.</p>\n<p>The prices advertised for a SIM-swap against T-Mobile customers in the latter half of 2022 ranged between USD $1,000 and $1,500, while SIM-swaps offered against AT&amp;T and Verizon customers often cost well more than twice that amount.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62880\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mobiletheft.png\" width=\"707\" /></p>\n<p>To be clear, KrebsOnSecurity is not aware of specific SIM-swapping incidents tied to any of these breach claims. However, the vast majority of advertisements for SIM-swapping claims against T-Mobile tracked in this story had two things in common that set them apart from random SIM-swapping ads on Telegram.</p>\n<p>First, they included an offer to use a mutually trusted &#8220;middleman&#8221; or escrow provider for the transaction (to protect either party from getting scammed). More importantly, the cybercriminal handles that were posting ads for SIM-swapping opportunities from these groups generally did so on a daily or near-daily basis &#8212; often teasing their upcoming swap events in the hours before posting a &#8220;Tmo up!&#8221; message announcement.</p>\n<p>In other words, if the crooks offering these SIM-swapping services were ripping off their customers or claiming to have access that they didn&#8217;t, this would be almost immediately obvious from the responses of the more seasoned and serious cybercriminals in the same chat channel.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of people on Telegram claiming to have SIM-swap access at major telecommunications firms, but a great many such offers are simply four-figure scams, and any pretenders on this front are soon identified and banned (<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/09/violence-as-a-service-brickings-firebombings-shootings-for-hire/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if not worse</a>).</p>\n<p>One of the groups that reliably posted &#8220;Tmo up!&#8221; messages to announce SIM-swap availability against T-Mobile customers also reliably posted &#8220;Tmo down!&#8221; follow-up messages announcing exactly when their claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools was discovered and revoked by the mobile giant.</p>\n<p>A review of the timestamps associated with this group&#8217;s incessant &#8220;Tmo up&#8221; and &#8220;Tmo down&#8221; posts indicates that while their claimed access to employee tools usually lasted less than an hour, in some cases that access apparently went undiscovered for several hours or even days.<span id=\"more-62757\"></span></p>\n<h2>TMO TOOLS</h2>\n<p>How could these SIM-swapping groups be gaining access to T-Mobile&#8217;s network as frequently as they claim? Peppered throughout the daily chit-chat on their Telegram channels are solicitations for people urgently needed to serve as &#8220;callers,&#8221; or those who can be hired to social engineer employees over the phone into navigating to a phishing website and entering their employee credentials.</p>\n<p><strong>Allison Nixon </strong>is chief research officer for the New York City-based cybersecurity firm <a href=\"https://unit221b.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unit 221B</a>. Nixon said these SIM-swapping groups will typically call employees on their mobile devices, pretend to be someone from the company&#8217;s IT department, and then try to get the person on the other end of the line to visit a phishing website that mimics the company&#8217;s employee login page.</p>\n<p>Nixon argues that many people in the security community tend to discount the threat from voice phishing attacks as somehow &#8220;low tech&#8221; and &#8220;low probability&#8221; threats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see it as not low-tech at all, because there are a lot of moving parts to phishing these days,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;You have the caller who has the employee on the line, and the person operating the phish kit who needs to spin it up and down fast enough so that it doesn&#8217;t get flagged by security companies. Then they have to get the employee on that phishing site and steal their credentials.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition, she said, often there will be yet another co-conspirator whose job it is to use the stolen credentials and log into employee tools. That person may also need to figure out how to make their device pass &#8220;posture checks,&#8221; a form of device authentication that some companies use to verify that each login is coming only from employer-issued phones or laptops.</p>\n<p>For aspiring criminals with little experience in scam calling, there are plenty of sample call transcripts available on these Telegram chat channels that walk one through how to impersonate an IT technician at the targeted company &#8212; and how to respond to pushback or skepticism from the employee. Here&#8217;s a snippet from one such tutorial that appeared recently in one of the SIM-swapping channels:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hello this is James calling from Metro IT department, how&#8217;s your day today?&#8221;</p>\n<p>(yea im doing good, how r u)</p>\n<p>i&#8217;m doing great, thank you for asking</p>\n<p>i&#8217;m calling in regards to a ticket we got last week from you guys, saying you guys were having issues with the network connectivity which also interfered with [Microsoft] Edge, not letting you sign in or disconnecting you randomly. We haven&#8217;t received any updates to this ticket ever since it was created so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m calling in just to see if there&#8217;s still an issue or not&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>TMO DOWN!</h2>\n<p>The TMO UP data referenced above, combined with comments from the SIM-swappers themselves, indicate that while many of their claimed accesses to T-Mobile tools in the middle of 2022 lasted hours on end, both the frequency and duration of these events began to steadily decrease as the year wore on.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-45224\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/phonescam.png\" width=\"751\" /></p>\n<p>T-Mobile declined to discuss what it may have done to combat these apparent intrusions last year. However, one of the groups began to complain loudly in late October 2022 that T-Mobile must have been doing something that was causing their phished access to employee tools to die very soon after they obtained it.</p>\n<p>One group even remarked that they suspected T-Mobile&#8217;s security team had begun monitoring their chats.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the timestamps associated with one group&#8217;s TMO UP/TMO DOWN notices show that their claimed access was often limited to less than 15 minutes throughout November and December of 2022.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, the calendar graphic above clearly shows that the frequency of claimed access to T-Mobile decreased significantly across all three SIM-swapping groups in the waning weeks of 2022.</p>\n<h2>SECURITY KEYS</h2>\n<p>T-Mobile US reported revenues of nearly $80 billion last year. It currently employs more than 71,000 people in the United States, any one of whom can be a target for these phishers.</p>\n<p>T-Mobile declined to answer questions about what it may be doing to beef up employee authentication. But <strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong>, a researcher and lecturer at University of California, Berkeley&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">International Computer Science Institute</a>, said T-Mobile and all the major wireless providers should be requiring employees to use physical security keys for that second factor when logging into company resources.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_28417\" style=\"width: 269px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-28417\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/yubikey-285x346.png\" width=\"259\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-28417\">A U2F device made by Yubikey.</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;These breaches should not happen,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;Because T-Mobile should have long ago issued all employees security keys and switched to security keys for the second factor. And because security keys provably block this style of attack.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most commonly used security keys are inexpensive USB-based devices. A security key implements a form of multi-factor authentication known as Universal 2nd Factor (U2F), which allows the user to complete the login process simply by inserting the USB key and pressing a button on the device. The key works without the need for any special software drivers.</p>\n<p>The allure of U2F devices for multi-factor authentication is that even if an employee who has enrolled a security key for authentication tries to log in at an impostor site, the company\u2019s systems simply refuse to request the security key if the user isn\u2019t on their employer\u2019s legitimate website, and the login attempt fails. Thus, the second factor cannot be phished, either over the phone or Internet.</p>\n<h2>THE ROLE OF MINORS IN SIM-SWAPPING</h2>\n<p>Nixon said one confounding aspect of SIM-swapping is that these criminal groups tend to recruit teenagers to do their dirty work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A huge reason this problem has been allowed to spiral out of control is because children play such a prominent role in this form of breach,&#8221; Nixon said.</p>\n<p>Nixon said SIM-swapping groups often advertise low-level jobs on places like <strong>Roblox</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong>, online games that are extremely popular with young adolescent males.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Statistically speaking, that kind of recruiting is going to produce a lot of people who are underage,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They recruit children because they&#8217;re naive, you can get more out of them, and they have legal protections that other people over 18 don&#8217;t have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, she said, even when underage SIM-swappers are arrested, the offenders tend to go right back to committing the same crimes as soon as they&#8217;re released.</p>\n<p>In January 2023, T-Mobile <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/new-t-mobile-breach-affects-37-million-accounts/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed</a> that a &#8220;bad actor&#8221; stole records on roughly 37 million current customers, including their name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, and T-Mobile account number.</p>\n<p>In August 2021, T-Mobile acknowledged that hackers made off with the names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license/ID information on more than 40 million current, former or prospective customers who applied for credit with the company. That breach came to light after\u00a0<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-breach-exposed-ssn-dob-of-40m-people/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a hacker began selling the records on a cybercrime forum</a>.</p>\n<p>In the shadow of such mega-breaches, any damage from the continuous attacks by these SIM-swapping groups can seem insignificant by comparison. But Nixon says it&#8217;s a mistake to dismiss SIM-swapping as a low volume problem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Logistically, you may only be able to get a few dozen or a hundred SIM-swaps in a day, but you can pick <em>any</em> customer you want across their entire customer base,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just because a targeted account takeover is low volume doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s low risk. These guys have crews that go and identify people who are high net worth individuals and who have a lot to lose.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nixon said another aspect of SIM-swapping that causes cybersecurity defenders to dismiss the threat from these groups is the perception that they are full of low-skilled &#8220;script kiddies,&#8221; a derisive term used to describe novice hackers who rely mainly on point-and-click hacking tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They underestimate these actors and say this person isn&#8217;t technically sophisticated,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But if you&#8217;re rolling around in millions worth of stolen crypto currency, you can buy that sophistication. I know for a fact some of these compromises were at the hands of these &#8216;script kiddies,&#8217; but they&#8217;re not ripping off other people&#8217;s scripts so much as hiring people to make scripts for them. And they don&#8217;t care what gets the job done, as long as they get to steal the money.&#8221;</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/hackers-claim-they-breached-t-mobile-more-than-100-times-in-2022/feed/", "slash_comments": "37"}, {"title": "When Low-Tech Hacks Cause High-Impact Breaches", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/", "value": "When Low-Tech Hacks Cause High-Impact Breaches"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/when-low-tech-hacks-cause-high-impact-breaches/"}], "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/when-low-tech-hacks-cause-high-impact-breaches/", "comments": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/when-low-tech-hacks-cause-high-impact-breaches/#comments", "authors": [{"name": "BrianKrebs"}], "author": "BrianKrebs", "author_detail": {"name": "BrianKrebs"}, "published": "Mon, 27 Feb 2023 04:15:15 +0000", "published_parsed": [2023, 2, 27, 4, 15, 15, 0, 58, 0], "tags": [{"term": "A Little Sunshine", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Ne'er-Do-Well News", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Web Fraud 2.0", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "escrow.com", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "GoDaddy breach December 2022", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "GoDaddy breach March 2020", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "GoDaddy breach November 2020", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "GoDaddy Breach November 2021", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "vishing", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "voice phishing", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "id": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=62835", "guidislink": false, "summary": "Web hosting giant GoDaddy made headlines this month when it disclosed that a multi-year breach allowed intruders to steal company source code, siphon customer and employee login credentials, and foist malware on customer websites.

GoDaddy described the incident at the time in general terms as a social engineering attack, but one of its customers affected by that March 2020 breach actually spoke to one of the hackers involved.</p>\n<p>The hackers were able to change the Domain Name System (DNS) records for the transaction brokering site <strong>escrow.com</strong> so that it pointed to an address in Malaysia that was host to just a few other domains, including the <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/d6de464d-f30d-4350-8324-d0f8997daf38/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">then brand-new phishing domain</a> <strong>servicenow-godaddy[.]com</strong>.</p>\n<p>The general manager of Escrow.com found himself on the phone with one of the GoDaddy hackers, after someone who claimed they worked at GoDaddy called and said they needed him to authorize some changes to the account.</p>\n<p>In reality, the caller had just tricked a GoDaddy employee into giving away their credentials, and he could see from the employee&#8217;s account that Escrow.com required a specific security procedure to complete a domain transfer.</p>\n<p>The general manager of Escrow.com said he suspected the call was a scam, but decided to play along for about an hour &#8212; all the while recording the call and coaxing information out of the scammer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This guy had access to the notes, and knew the number to call,&#8221; to make changes to the account, the CEO of Escrow.com told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;He was literally reading off the tickets to the notes of the admin panel inside GoDaddy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>About halfway through this conversation &#8212; after being called out by the general manager as an imposter &#8212; the hacker admitted that he was not a GoDaddy employee, and that he was in fact part of a group that enjoyed repeated success with social engineering employees at targeted companies over the phone.</p>\n<p>Absent from GoDaddy&#8217;s SEC statement is another spate of attacks in November 2020, in which unknown intruders <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/godaddy-employees-used-in-attacks-on-multiple-cryptocurrency-services/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">redirected email and web traffic for multiple cryptocurrency services</a> that used GoDaddy in some capacity.</p>\n<p>It is possible this incident was not mentioned because it was the work of yet another group of intruders. But in response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity at the time, GoDaddy said that incident also stemmed from a &#8220;limited&#8221; number of GoDaddy employees falling for a sophisticated social engineering scam.<span id=\"more-62835\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;As threat actors become increasingly sophisticated and aggressive in their attacks, we are constantly educating employees about new tactics that might be used against them and adopting new security measures to prevent future attacks,&#8221; GoDaddy said in a written statement back in 2020.</p>\n<p>Voice phishing or &#8220;vishing&#8221; attacks typically target employees who work remotely. The phishers will usually claim that they\u2019re calling from the employer\u2019s IT department, supposedly to help troubleshoot some issue. The goal is to convince the target to enter their credentials at a website set up by the attackers that mimics the organization\u2019s corporate email or VPN portal.</p>\n<p>Experts interviewed for an <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/voice-phishers-targeting-corporate-vpns/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">August 2020 story on a steep rise in successful voice phishing attacks</a> said there are generally at least two people involved in each vishing scam: One who is social engineering the target over the phone, and another co-conspirator who takes any credentials entered at the phishing page &#8212; including multi-factor authentication codes shared by the victim &#8212; and quickly uses them to log in to the company&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>The attackers are usually careful to do nothing with the phishing domain until they are ready to initiate a vishing call to a potential victim. And when the attack or call is complete, they disable the website tied to the domain.</p>\n<p>This is key because many domain registrars will only respond to external requests to take down a phishing website if the site is live at the time of the abuse complaint. This tactic also can stymie efforts by companies that focus on identifying newly-registered phishing domains before they can be used for fraud.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_28417\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-28417\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/yubikey.png\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-28417\">A U2F device made by Yubikey.</p></div>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s latest SEC filing indicates the company had nearly 7,000 employees as of December 2022. In addition, GoDaddy contracts with another 3,000 people who work full-time for the company via business process outsourcing companies based primarily in India, the Philippines and Colombia.</p>\n<p>Many companies now require employees to supply a one-time password &#8212; such as one sent via SMS or produced by a mobile authenticator app &#8212; in addition to their username and password when logging in to company assets online. But both SMS and app-based codes can be undermined by phishing attacks that simply request this information in addition to the user&#8217;s password.</p>\n<p>One multifactor option \u2014 physical security keys \u2014 appears to be immune to these advanced scams. The most commonly used security keys are inexpensive USB-based devices. A security key implements a form of multi-factor authentication known as Universal 2nd Factor (U2F), which allows the user to complete the login process simply by inserting the USB device and pressing a button on the device. The key works without the need for any special software drivers.</p>\n<p>The allure of U2F devices for multi-factor authentication is that even if an employee who has enrolled a security key for authentication tries to log in at an impostor site, the company\u2019s systems simply refuse to request the security key if the user isn\u2019t on their employer\u2019s legitimate website, and the login attempt fails. Thus, the second factor cannot be phished, either over the phone or Internet.</p>\n<p>In July 2018, Google <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed</a> that it had not had any of its 85,000+ employees successfully phished on their work-related accounts since early 2017, when it began requiring all employees to use physical security keys in place of one-time codes.</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/when-low-tech-hacks-cause-high-impact-breaches/feed/", "slash_comments": "12"}, {"title": "Who\u2019s Behind the Botnet-Based Service BHProxies?", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/", "value": "Who\u2019s Behind the Botnet-Based Service BHProxies?"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/whos-behind-the-botnet-based-service-bhproxies/"}], "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/whos-behind-the-botnet-based-service-bhproxies/", "comments": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/whos-behind-the-botnet-based-service-bhproxies/#comments", "authors": [{"name": "BrianKrebs"}], "author": "BrianKrebs", "author_detail": {"name": "BrianKrebs"}, "published": "Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:51:23 +0000", "published_parsed": [2023, 2, 24, 19, 51, 23, 4, 55, 0], "tags": [{"term": "A Little Sunshine", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Ne'er-Do-Well News", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Web Fraud 2.0", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Abdala Tawfik", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Abdalla Khafagy", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "BHProxies", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "BitSight", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Constella Intelligence", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "hassan_isabad_subar", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Intel 471", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "LewkLabs", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Minerva Labs", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Mylobot", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "id": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=62690", "guidislink": false, "summary": "A security firm has discovered that a five-year-old crafty botnet known as Mylobot appears to be powering a residential proxy service called BHProxies, which offers paying customers the ability to route their web traffic anonymously through compromised computers.

But according to <a href=\"https://www.bitsight.com/blog/mylobot-investigating-proxy-botnet\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a new report</a> from <strong>BitSight</strong>, the Mylobot botnet&#8217;s main functionality has always been about transforming the infected system into a proxy.</p>\n<p>The Mylobot malware includes more than 1,000 hard-coded and encrypted domain names, any one of which can be registered and used as control networks for the infected hosts. BitSight researchers found significant overlap in the Internet addresses used by those domains and a domain called <strong>BHproxies[.]com</strong>.</p>\n<p>BHProxies sells access to &#8220;residential proxy&#8221; networks, which allow someone to rent a residential IP address to use as a relay for their Internet communications, providing anonymity and the advantage of being perceived as a residential user surfing the web. The service is currently advertising access to more than 150,000 devices globally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At this point, we cannot prove that BHProxies is linked to Mylobot, but we have a strong suspicion,&#8221; wrote BitSight&#8217;s <strong>Stanislas Arnoud</strong>.</p>\n<p>To test their hypothesis, BitSight obtained 50 proxies from BHProxies. The researchers were able to use 48 of those 50 proxies to browse to a website they controlled &#8212; allowing them to record the true IP addresses of each proxy device.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Among these 48 recovered residential proxies IP addresses, 28 (58.3%) of those were already present in our sinkhole systems, associated with the Mylobot malware family,&#8221; Arnoud continued. &#8220;This number is probably higher, but we don&#8217;t have a full visibility of the botnet. This gave us clear evidence that Mylobot infected computers are used by the BHProxies service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>BitSight said it is currently seeing more than 50,000 unique Mylobot infected systems every day, and that India appears to be the most targeted country, followed by the United States, Indonesia and Iran.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe we are only seeing part of the full botnet, which may lead to more than 150,000 infected computers as advertised by BHProxies\u2019 operators,&#8221; Arnoud wrote.</p>\n<h2>WHO&#8217;S BEHIND BHPROXIES?</h2>\n<p>The website BHProxies[.]com has been advertised for nearly a decade on the forum <strong>Black Hat World</strong> by the user <strong>BHProxies</strong>. BHProxies has authored 129 posts on Black Hat World since 2012, and their last post on the forum was in December 2022. </p>\n<p>BHProxies initially was fairly active on Black Hat World between May and November 2012, after which it suddenly ceased all activity.

for the first time ever &#8212; includes provisions for the replacement of stolen EBT benefits. This is a big deal because in 2022, organized crime groups <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/10/how-card-skimming-disproportionally-affects-those-most-in-need/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">began massively targeting EBT accounts</a> &#8212; often emptying affected accounts at ATMs <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-08/ebt-fraud-la-county\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">immediately after the states disperse funds each month</a>.</p>\n<p>EBT cards can be used along with a personal identification number (PIN) to pay for goods at participating stores, and to withdraw cash from an ATM. However, EBT cards differ from debit cards issued to most Americans in two important ways. First, most states do not equip EBT cards with smart chip technology, which can make the cards more difficult and expensive for skimming thieves to clone.</p>\n<p>More critically, EBT participants traditionally have had little hope of recovering food assistance funds when their cards were copied by card-skimming devices and used for fraud. That&#8217;s because while the EBT programs are operated by individually by the states, those programs are funded by the <strong>U.S. Department of Agriculture</strong> (USDA), which until late last year was barred from reimbursing states for stolen EBT funds.</p>\n<p>The protections passed in the 2023 Appropriations Act allow states to use federal funds to replace stolen EBT benefits, and they permit states to seek reimbursement for any skimmed EBT funds they may have replaced from their own coffers (dating back to Oct. 1, 2022).</p>\n<p>But first, all 50 states must each submit a plan for how they are going to protect and replace food benefits stolen via card skimming. Guidance for the states in drafting those plans was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023.01.31-State-Plan-Guidance-Replacement-of-Stolen-Benefits-a.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued by the USDA on Jan. 31</a> (PDF), and states that don&#8217;t get them done before Feb. 27, 2023 risk losing the ability to be reimbursed for EBT fraud losses.</p>\n<p><strong>Deborah Harris</strong> is a staff attorney at <strong>The Massachusetts Law Reform Institute</strong> (MLRI), a nonprofit legal assistance organization that has closely tracked the EBT skimming epidemic. In November 2022, the MLRI <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/lawsuit-seeks-food-benefits-stolen-by-skimmers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">filed a class-action lawsuit against Massachusetts</a> on behalf of thousands of low-income families who were collectively robbed of more than $1 million in food assistance benefits by card skimming devices secretly installed at cash machines and grocery store checkout lanes across the state.</p>\n<p>Harris said she&#8217;s pleased that the USDA guidelines were issued so promptly, and that the guidance for states was not overly prescriptive. For example, some security experts have suggested that adding contactless capability to EBT cards could help participants avoid skimming devices altogether. But Harris said contactless cards do not require a PIN, which is the only thing that stops EBT cards from being drained at the ATM when a participant&#8217;s card is lost or stolen.</p>\n<p>Then again, nothing in the guidance even mentions chip-based cards, or any other advice for improving the physical security of EBT cards. Rather, it suggests states should seek to develop the capability to perform basic fraud detection and alerting on suspicious transactions, such as when an EBT card that is normally used only in one geographic area suddenly is used to withdraw cash at an ATM halfway across the country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides having the states move fast to approve their plans, we&#8217;d also like to see a focused effort to move states from magstripe-only cards to chip, and also assisting states to develop the algorithms that will enable them to identify likely incidents of stolen benefits,&#8221; Harris said.</p>\n<p>Harris said Massachusetts has begun using algorithms to look for these suspicious transaction patterns throughout its EBT network, and now has the ability to alert households and verify transactions. But she said most states do not have this capability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have heard that other states aren&#8217;t currently able to do that,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;But encouraging states to more affirmatively identify instances of likely theft and assisting with the claims and verification process is critical. Most households can&#8217;t do that on their own, and in Massachusetts it&#8217;s very hard for a person to get a copy of their transaction history. Some states can do that through third-party apps, but something so basic should not be on the burden of EBT households.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some states aren&#8217;t waiting for direction from the federal government to beef up EBT card security. Like Maryland, which identified more than 1,400 households hit by EBT skimming attacks last year &#8212; a tenfold increase over 2021.<span id=\"more-62561\"></span></p>\n<p>Advocates for EBT beneficiaries in Maryland are backing <a href=\"https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2023RS/bills/sb/sb0401f.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Senate Bill 401</a> (PDF), which would require the use of chip technology and ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity (a hearing on SB401 is scheduled in the Maryland Senate Finance Commission for Thursday, Feb. 23, at 1 p.m.).</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle Salomon Madaio</strong> is a director at the <a href=\"https://www.hprplaw.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Homeless Persons Representation Project</a>,\u00a0a legal assistance organization based in Silver Spring, Md. Madaio said the bill would require the state Department of Human Services to replace skimmed benefits, not only after the bill goes into effect but also retroactively from January 2020 to the present.</p>\n<p>Madaio said the bill also would require the state to monitor for patterns of suspicious activity on EBT cards, and to develop a mechanism to contact potentially affected households.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For most of the skimming victims we&#8217;ve worked with, the fraudulent transactions would be pretty easy to spot because they mostly happened in the middle of the night or out of state, or both,&#8221; Madaio said. &#8220;To make matters worse, a lot of families whose benefits were scammed then incurred late fees on many other things as a result.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to see why organized crime groups have pounced on EBT cards as easy money. In most traditional payment card transactions, there are usually several parties that have a financial interest in minimizing fraud and fraud losses, including the bank that issued the card, the card network (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, etc.), and the merchant.</p>\n<p>But that infrastructure simply does not exist within state EBT programs, and it certainly isn&#8217;t a thing at the inter-state level. What that means is that the vast majority of EBT cards have zero fraud controls, which is exactly what continues to make them so appealing to thieves.</p>\n<p>For now, the only fraud controls available to most EBT cardholders include being especially paranoid about where they use their cards, and frequently changing their PINs.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/usda-snapskim.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">USDA guidance</a> issued prior to the passage of the appropriations act, EBT cardholders <em>should consider changing their card PIN at least once a month</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By changing PINs frequently, at least monthly, and doing so before benefit issuance dates, households can minimize their risk of stolen benefits from a previously skimmed EBT card,&#8221; the USDA advised.</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/new-protections-for-food-benefits-stolen-by-skimmers/feed/", "slash_comments": "32"}, {"title": "Microsoft Patch Tuesday, February 2023 Edition", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/", "value": "Microsoft Patch Tuesday, February 2023 Edition"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/microsoft-patch-tuesday-february-2023-edition/"}], "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/microsoft-patch-tuesday-february-2023-edition/", "comments": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/microsoft-patch-tuesday-february-2023-edition/#comments", "authors": [{"name": "BrianKrebs"}], "author": "BrianKrebs", "author_detail": {"name": "BrianKrebs"}, "published": "Tue, 14 Feb 2023 21:01:41 +0000", "published_parsed": [2023, 2, 14, 21, 1, 41, 1, 45, 0], "tags": [{"term": "Latest Warnings", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Security Tools", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Time to Patch", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "CVE-2023-21529", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "CVE-2023-21706", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "CVE-2023-21707", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "CVE-2023-21715", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "CVE-2023-21716", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "CVE-2023-21823", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "CVE-2023-23376", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Dustin Childs", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Immersive Labs", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Internet Explorer 11", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Johannes Ullrich", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Kevin Breen", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Mandiant", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Microsoft Office", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Microsoft Patch Tuesday February 2023", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "sans internet storm center", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "id": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=62660", "guidislink": false, "summary": "Microsoft is sending the world a whole bunch of love today, in the form of patches to plug dozens of security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software.

Redmond flags <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23376\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-23376</a> as an &#8220;Important&#8221; elevation of privilege vulnerability in the <strong>Windows Common Log File System Driver</strong>, which is present in Windows 10 and 11 systems, as well as many server versions of Windows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sadly, there\u2019s just a little solid information about this privilege escalation,&#8221; said <strong>Dustin Childs</strong>, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro&#8217;s <strong>Zero Day Initiative</strong>. \u201cMicrosoft does note that the vulnerability would allow an attacker to exploit code as SYSTEM, which would allow them to completely take over a target. This is likely being chained with a remote code execution bug to spread malware or ransomware. Considering this was discovered by Microsoft\u2019s Threat Intelligence Center, it could mean it was used by advanced threat actors. Either way, make sure you test and roll these fixes quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p>The zero-day <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21715\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-21715</a> is a weakness in <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> that Redmond describes as a &#8220;security feature bypass vulnerability.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Microsoft lists this as under active exploit, but they offer no info on how widespread these exploits may be,&#8221; Childs said. \u201cBased on the write-up, it sounds more like a privilege escalation than a security feature bypass, but regardless, active attacks in a common enterprise application shouldn\u2019t be ignored. It\u2019s always alarming when a security feature is not just bypassed but exploited. Let\u2019s hope the fix comprehensively addresses the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>The third zero-day flaw already seeing exploitation is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21823\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-21823</a>, which is another elevation of privilege weakness &#8212; this one in the <strong>Microsoft Windows Graphic</strong> component. Researchers at cybersecurity forensics firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> were credited with reporting the bug.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Breen</strong>, director of cyber threat research at <strong>Immersive Labs</strong>, pointed out that the security bulletin for CVE-2023-21823 specifically calls out <strong>OneNote</strong> as being a vulnerable component for the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In recent weeks, we have seen an increase in the use of OneNote files as part of <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-now-use-microsoft-onenote-attachments-to-spread-malware/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">targeted malware campaigns</a>,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;Patches for this are delivered via the app stores and not through the typical formats, so it&#8217;s important to double check your organization&#8217;s policies.&#8221;<span id=\"more-62660\"></span></p>\n<p>Microsoft fixed another Office vulnerability in <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21716\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-21716</a>, which is a <strong>Microsoft Word</strong> bug that can lead to remote code execution &#8212; even if a booby-trapped Word document is merely viewed in the preview pane of <strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong>. This security hole has a CVSS (severity) score of 9.8 out of a possible 10.</p>\n<p>Microsoft also has more valentines for organizations that rely on <strong>Microsoft Exchange Server</strong> to handle email. Redmond patched three Exchange Server flaws (<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21706\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-21706</a>, <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21707\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-21707</a>, and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21529\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-21529</a>), all of which Microsoft says are remote code execution flaws that are likely to be exploited.</p>\n<p>Microsoft said authentication is required to exploit these bugs, but then again threat groups that attack Exchange vulnerabilities also tend to phish targets for their Exchange credentials.</p>\n<p>Microsoft isn&#8217;t alone in dropping fixes for scary, ill-described zero-day flaws. Apple on Feb. 13 released an update for iOS that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/actively-exploited-webkit-vulnerability-fixed-in-ios-16-3-1-macos-13-2-1-updates/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resolves a zero-day vulnerability in Webkit</a>, Apple&#8217;s open source browser engine. <strong>Johannes Ullrich</strong> at the <strong>SANS Internet Storm Center</strong> notes that in addition to the WebKit problem, Apple fixed a privilege escalation issue. Both flaws are fixed in iOS 16.3.1.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This privilege escalation issue could be used to escape the browser sandbox and gain full system access after executing code via the WebKit vulnerability,&#8221; Ullrich warned.</p>\n<p>On a lighter note (hopefully), Microsoft drove the final nail in the coffin for <strong>Internet Explorer 11 (IE11)</strong>. According to Redmond, the out-of-support IE11 desktop application was permanently disabled on certain versions of Windows 10 on February 14, 2023 through a <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All remaining consumer and commercial devices that were not already redirected from IE11 to Microsoft Edge were redirected with the Microsoft Edge update. Users will be unable to reverse the change,&#8221; Microsoft <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/internet-explorer-11-desktop-app-retirement-faq/ba-p/2366549\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a>. &#8220;Additionally, redirection from IE11 to Microsoft Edge will be included as part of all future Microsoft Edge updates. IE11 visual references, such as the IE11 icons on the Start Menu and taskbar, will be removed by the June 2023 Windows security update (\u201cB\u201d release) scheduled for June 13, 2023.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For a more granular rundown on the updates released today, see\u00a0<a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20February%202023%20Patch%20Tuesday/29548\" rel=\"noopener\">the SANS Internet Storm Center roundup</a>.
