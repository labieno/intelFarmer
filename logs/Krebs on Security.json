Image: News 12 Westchester.</p></div>\n<p>In an affidavit filed with the District Court for the Southern District of New York, FBI Special Agent <strong>John Longmire</strong> said that at around 4:30 p.m. on March 15, 2023, he led a team of law enforcement agents that made a probable cause arrest of a <strong>Conor Brian Fitzpatrick</strong> in Peekskill, NY.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I arrested the defendant on March 15, 2023, he stated to me in substance and in part that: a) his name was Conor Brian Fitzpatrick; b) he used the alias &#8216;pompompurin/&#8217; and c) he was the owner and administrator of &#8216;BreachForums&#8217; the data breach website referenced in the Complaint,&#8221; Longmire wrote.</p>\n<p>Pompompurin has been something of a nemesis to the FBI for several years. In November 2021, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/hoax-email-blast-abused-poor-coding-in-fbi-website/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of fake emails about a cybercrime investigation were blasted out from the FBI&#8217;s email systems and Internet addresses</a>.</p>\n<p>Pompompurin took credit for that stunt, and said he was able to send the FBI email blast by exploiting a flaw in an FBI portal designed to share information with state and local law enforcement authorities. The FBI later acknowledged that a software misconfiguration allowed someone to send the fake emails.</p>\n<p>In December, 2022, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/12/fbis-vetted-info-sharing-network-infragard-hacked/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hackers active on BreachForums had infiltrated the FBI&#8217;s InfraGard program</a>, a vetted FBI program designed to build cyber and physical threat information sharing partnerships with experts in the private sector. The hackers impersonated the CEO of a major financial company, applied for InfraGard membership in the CEO&#8217;s name, and were granted admission to the community.</p>\n<p>From there, the hackers plundered the InfraGard member database, and proceeded to sell contact information on more than 80,000 InfraGard members in an auction on BreachForums. The FBI responded by disabling the portal for some time, before ultimately forcing all InfraGard members to re-apply for membership.<span id=\"more-63100\"></span></p>\n<p>More recently, BreachForums was the sales forum for <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/dc-health-data-posted-online/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data stolen</a> from <strong>DC Health Link</strong>, a health insurance exchange based in Washington, D.C. that suffered a data breach this month. The sales thread initially said the data included the names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health plan and enrollee information and more on 170,000 individuals, although the official notice about the breach says 56,415 people were affected.</p>\n<p>In April 2022, U.S. Justice Department <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/raidforums-get-raided-alleged-admin-arrested/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seized the servers and domains for RaidForums</a>, an extremely popular English-language cybercrime forum that sold access to more than 10 billion consumer records stolen in some of the world\u2019s largest data breaches since 2015. As part of that operation, the feds also charged the alleged administrator, 21-year-old Diogo Santos Coelho of Portugal, with six criminal counts.</p>\n<p>Coelho was arrested in the United Kingdom on Jan. 31, 2022. By that time, the new BreachForums had been live for just under a week, but with a familiar look.</p>\n<p>BreachForums remains accessible online, and from reviewing the live chat stream on the site&#8217;s home page it appears the forum&#8217;s active users are only just becoming aware that their administrator &#8212; and the site&#8217;s database &#8212; is likely now in FBI hands:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_63109\" style=\"width: 761px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/breachedruhroh.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-63109\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/breachedruhroh.png\" width=\"751\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-63109\">Members of BreachForums discuss the arrest of the forum&#8217;s alleged owner.</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;Wait if they arrested pom then doesn&#8217;t the FBI have all of our details we&#8217;ve registered with?&#8221; asked one worried BreachForums member.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But we all have good VPNs I guess, right&#8230;right guys?&#8221; another denizen offered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like pom would most likely do a plea bargain and cooperate with the feds as much as possible,&#8221; replied another.</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick could not be immediately reached for comment. The FBI declined to comment for this story.</p>\n<p>There is only one page to the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pomcomplaint.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">criminal complaint against Fitzpatrick</a> (PDF), which charges him with one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud.

Microsoft said it has seen evidence that attackers are exploiting this flaw, which can be done without any user interaction by sending a booby-trapped email that triggers automatically when retrieved by the email server &#8212; <em>before the email is even viewed in the Preview Pane</em>.</p>\n<p>While CVE-2023-23397 is labeled as an &#8220;Elevation of Privilege&#8221; vulnerability, that label doesn\u2019t accurately reflect its severity, said <strong>Kevin Breen</strong>, director of cyber threat research at <strong>Immersive Labs</strong>.</p>\n<p>Known as an NTLM relay attack, it allows an attacker to get someone\u2019s NTLM hash [Windows account password] and use it in an attack commonly referred to as &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pass The Hash</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The vulnerability effectively lets the attacker authenticate as a trusted individual without having to know the person\u2019s password,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;This is on par with an attacker having a valid password with access to an organization\u2019s systems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Security firm <strong>Rapid7</strong> points out that this bug affects self-hosted versions of Outlook like <strong>Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise</strong>, but Microsoft-hosted online services like <strong>Microsoft 365</strong> are <em>not</em> vulnerable.<span id=\"more-63082\"></span></p>\n<p>The other zero-day flaw being actively exploited in the wild &#8212; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-24880\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-24880</a> &#8212; is a &#8220;Security Feature Bypass&#8221; in <strong>Windows SmartScreen</strong>, part of Microsoft&#8217;s slate of endpoint protection tools.</p>\n<p>Patch management vendor <strong>Action1</strong> notes that the exploit for this bug is low in complexity and requires no special privileges. But it does require some user interaction, and can&#8217;t be used to gain access to private information or privileges. However, the flaw can allow other malicious code to run without being detected by SmartScreen reputation checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Dustin Childs</strong>, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro&#8217;s <strong>Zero Day Initiative</strong>, said CVE-2023-24880 allows attackers to create files that would bypass Mark of the Web (MOTW) defenses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Protective measures like SmartScreen and Protected View in Microsoft Office rely on MOTW, so bypassing these makes it easier for threat actors to spread malware via crafted documents and other infected files that would otherwise be stopped by SmartScreen,&#8221; Childs said.</p>\n<p>Seven other vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this week earned its most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; severity label, meaning the updates address security holes that could be exploited to give the attacker full, remote control over a Windows host with little or no interaction from the user.</p>\n<p>Also this week, Adobe released eight patches addressing a whopping 105 security holes across a variety of products, including <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Cold Fusion</strong>, <strong>Experience Manager</strong>, <strong>Dimension</strong>, <strong>Commerce</strong>, <strong>Magento</strong>, <strong>Substance 3D Stager</strong>, <strong>Cloud Desktop Applicatio</strong>n, and <strong>Illustrator</strong>.</p>\n<p>For a more granular rundown on the updates released today, see the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20March%202023%20Patch%20Tuesday/29634\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SANS Internet Storm Center roundup</a>.

The government refers to this community only as &#8220;<strong>Forum-1</strong>,&#8221; saying that it is administered by the leader of ViLE (referenced in the complaint as &#8220;CC-1&#8221;).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Victims are extorted into paying CC-1 to have their information removed from Forum-1,&#8221; prosecutors allege. &#8220;Singh also uses the threat of revealing personal information to extort victims into giving him access to their social media accounts, which Singh then resells.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sources tell KrebsOnSecurity in addition to being members of ViLE, both Weep and Ominous are or were staff members for <strong>Doxbin</strong>, a highly toxic online community that provides a forum for digging up personal information on people and posting it publicly. This is supported by the Doxbin administrator&#8217;s claimed responsibility for a high-profile intrusion at the DEA&#8217;s law enforcement data sharing portal last year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_59765\" style=\"width: 761px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/esp-screenshot.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-59765\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/esp-screenshot.png\" width=\"751\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-59765\">A screenshot of alleged access to the Drug Enforcement Agency&#8217;s intelligence sharing portal, shared by &#8220;KT,&#8221; the current administrator of the doxing and harassment community Doxbin.</p></div>\n<p>The government alleges that on May 7, 2022, Singh used stolen credentials to log into a U.S. federal government portal without authorization. The complaint doesn&#8217;t specify which agency portal was hacked, but it does state that the portal included access to law enforcement databases that track narcotics seizures in the United States.</p>\n<p>On May 12, 2022, KrebsOnSecurity <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/05/dea-investigating-breach-of-law-enforcement-data-portal/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">broke the news</a> that hackers had gained access to a DEA portal that taps into 16 different federal law enforcement databases.

When they raided Singh&#8217;s residence on Sept. 8, 2022 and seized his devices, investigators with Homeland Security found a cellular phone and laptop that allegedly &#8220;contained extensive evidence of access to the Portal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that between February 2022 and May 2022, Ceraolo used an official email account belonging to a Bangladeshi police official to pose as a police officer in communication with U.S.-based social media platforms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In these communications, Ceraolo requested personal information about users of these platforms, under the false pretense that the users were committing crimes or in life-threatening danger,&#8221; the complaint states.</p>\n<p>For example, on or about March 13, 2022, Ceraolo allegedly used the Bangladeshi police email account to falsely claim that the target of the EDR had sent bomb threats, distributed child pornography and threatened officials of the Bangladeshi government.</p>\n<p>On or about May 9, 2022, the government says, Singh sent a friend screenshots of text messages between himself and someone he had doxed on the Doxbin and was trying to extort for their Instagram handle. The data included the victim&#8217;s Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number, cellphone number, and home address.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Look familiar?\u201d Singh allegedly wrote to the victim. &#8220;You\u2019re gonna comply to me if you don\u2019t want anything negative to happen to your parents. . . I have every detail involving your parents . . . allowing me to do whatever I desire to them in malicious ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Neither of the defendants could be immediately reached for comment. KT, the current administrator of Doxbin, declined a request for comment on the charges.</p>\n<p>Ceraolo is a self-described security researcher who has been credited in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22nicholas+convict+ceraolo%22#ip=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">many news stories over the years</a> with discovering security vulnerabilities at <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong> and <strong>Cox Communications</strong>.</p>\n<p>Ceraolo&#8217;s stated partner in most of these discoveries &#8212; a 30-year-old Connecticut man named <strong>Ryan &#8220;Phobia&#8221; Stevenson</strong> &#8212; was charged in 2019 with being part of a group that stole millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies via <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim-swapping\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SIM-swapping</a>, a crime that involves tricking a mobile provider into routing a target&#8217;s calls and text messages to another device.</p>\n<p>In 2018, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how Stevenson earned bug bounty rewards and public recognition from top telecom companies for finding and reporting security holes in their websites, all the while <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/bug-bounty-hunter-ran-isp-doxing-service/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">secretly peddling those same vulnerabilities to cybercriminals</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the Justice Department, if convicted Ceraolo faces up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to commit wire fraud; both Ceraolo and Singh face five years\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to commit computer intrusions.</p>\n<p>A copy of the complaint against Ceraolo and Singh is <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Singh-and-Ceraolo-Complaint.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (PDF).</p>"

That website now features a seizure notice from the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice </strong>(DOJ), which says the domain was taken as part of &#8220;a coordinated law enforcement action taken against the NetWire Remote Access Trojan.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;As part of this week\u2019s law enforcement action, authorities in Croatia on Tuesday arrested a Croatian national who allegedly was the administrator of the website,&#8221; reads <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-authorities-seize-internet-domain-selling-malware-used-illegally-control-and\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a statement</a> by the DOJ today. &#8220;This defendant will be prosecuted by Croatian authorities. Additionally, law enforcement in Switzerland on Tuesday seized the computer server hosting the NetWire RAT infrastructure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Neither the DOJ&#8217;s statement nor <a href=\"https://www-index-hr.translate.goog/vijesti/clanak/kod-zagreba-uhicen-haker-hrvatskoj-policiji-u-istrazi-pomogao-fbi/2445145.aspx?index_tid=328489&amp;index_ref=naslovnica_vijesti_ostalo_d&amp;_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a press release</a> on the operation published by Croatian authorities mentioned the name of the accused. But it&#8217;s fairly remarkable that it has taken so long for authorities in the United States and elsewhere to move against NetWire and its alleged proprietor, given that the RAT&#8217;s author apparently did very little to hide his real-life identity.</p>\n<p>The WorldWiredLabs website first came online in February 2012 using a dedicated host with no other domains. The site&#8217;s true WHOIS registration records have always been hidden by privacy protection services, but there are plenty of clues in historical Domain Name System (DNS) records for WorldWiredLabs that point in the same direction.</p>\n<p>In October 2012, the WorldWiredLabs domain moved to another dedicated server at the Internet address 198.91.90.7, which was home to just one other domain: <strong>printschoolmedia[.]org</strong>, also registered in 2012.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.domaintools.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DomainTools.com</a>, printschoolmedia[.]org was registered to a <strong>Mario Zanko</strong> in Zapresic, Croatia, and to the email address <strong>zankomario@gmail.com</strong>. DomainTools further shows this email address was used to register one other domain in 2012: <strong>wwlabshosting[.]com</strong>, also registered to Mario Zanko from Croatia.</p>\n<p>A review of DNS records for both printschoolmedia[.]org and wwlabshosting[.]com shows that while these domains were online they both used the DNS name server <strong>ns1.worldwiredlabs[.]com</strong>. No other domains have been recorded using that same name server.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_62996\" style=\"width: 760px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-62996\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/wwl2013.png\" width=\"750\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-62996\">The WorldWiredLabs website, in 2013.

Constella also shows the email address zankomario@gmail.com used the password &#8220;dugidox2407.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2010, someone using the email address dugidox@gmail.com registered the domain <strong>dugidox[.]com</strong>. The WHOIS registration records for that domain list a &#8220;Senela Eanko&#8221; as the registrant, but the address used was the same street address in Zapresic that appears in the WHOIS records for printschoolmedia[.]org, which is registered in Mr. Zanco&#8217;s name.</p>\n<p>Prior to the demise of <strong>Google+</strong>, the email address dugidox@gmail.com mapped to an account with the nickname &#8220;<strong>Netwire wwl</strong>.&#8221; The dugidox email also was tied to a Facebook account (<strong>mario.zanko3</strong>), which featured check-ins and photos from various places in Croatia.</p>\n<p>That Facebook profile is no longer active, but back in January 2017, the administrator of WorldWiredLabs posted that he was considering adding certain Android mobile functionality to his service. Three days after that, the Mario.Zank3 profile posted a photo saying he was selected for an Android instruction course &#8212; with his dugidox email in the photo, naturally.</p>\n<p>Incorporation records from the U.K.&#8217;s Companies House show that in 2017 Mr. Zanko became an officer in a company called <strong>Godbex Solutions LTD</strong>. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO_qmXaiJ98\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube video</a> invoking this corporate name describes Godbex as a &#8220;next generation platform&#8221; for exchanging gold and cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>The U.K. Companies House records show Godbex was dissolved in 2020. It also says Mr. Zanko was born in July 1983, and lists his occupation as &#8220;electrical engineer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mr. Zanko did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p>A statement from the Croatian police about the NetWire takedown is <a href=\"https://policija.gov.hr/vijesti/u-sklopu-medjunarodne-policijske-akcije-hrvatska-policija-uhitila-hakera-s-podrucja-zagrebacke-zupanije/6944\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"

The lawsuit also seeks information about the identities of 20 different &#8220;John Does&#8221; &#8212; Freenom customers that Meta says have been particularly active in <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/d9118a63-0f82-42e8-b8b3-7e9a09d334bb/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">phishing attacks</a> against <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, and <strong>WhatsApp</strong> users.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit points to <a href=\"https://www.interisle.net/PhishingLandscape2021.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a 2021 study</a> (PDF) on the abuse of domains conducted by <strong>Interisle Consulting Group</strong>, which discovered that those ccTLDs operated by Freenom made up five of the Top Ten TLDs most abused by phishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The five ccTLDs to which Freenom provides its services are the TLDs of choice for cybercriminals because Freenom provides free domain name registration services and shields its customers&#8217; identity, even after being presented with evidence that the domain names are being used for illegal purposes,&#8221; the complaint charges. &#8220;Even after receiving notices of infringement or phishing by its customers, Freenom continues to license new infringing domain names to those same customers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meta further alleges that &#8220;Freenom has repeatedly failed to take appropriate steps to investigate and respond appropriately to reports of abuse,&#8221; and that it monetizes the traffic from infringing domains by reselling them and by adding &#8220;parking pages&#8221; that redirect visitors to other commercial websites, websites with pornographic content, and websites used for malicious activity like phishing.</p>\n<p>Freenom has not yet responded to requests for comment.

In June 2015, ICANN suspended Freenom&#8217;s ability to create new domain names or initiate inbound transfers of domain names for 90 days.

Establishing the concept of safe harbors allows the industry to mature incrementally, leveling up security best practices in order to retain a liability shield, versus calling for sweeping reform and unrealistic outcomes as previous regulatory attempts have.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>THE MOST ACTIVE, PERSISTENT THREAT</h2>\n<p>In 2012 (approximately three national cyber strategies ago), then director of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) <strong>Keith Alexander</strong> made headlines when he remarked that years of successful cyber espionage campaigns from Chinese state-sponsored hackers represented &#8220;the greatest transfer of wealth in history.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The document released today says the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) &#8220;now presents the broadest, most active, and most persistent threat to both government and private sector networks,&#8221; and says China is &#8220;the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many of the U.S. government&#8217;s efforts to restrain China&#8217;s technology prowess involve ongoing initiatives like the CHIPS Act, a new law signed by President Biden last year that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/business/economy/biden-tech-chips.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sets aside more than $50 billion to expand U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing and research</a> and to make the U.S. less dependent on foreign suppliers; the <a href=\"https://www.ai.gov/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Artificial Intelligence Initiative</a>; and the <a href=\"https://ntia.gov/other-publication/national-strategy-secure-5g-implementation-plan\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Strategy to Secure 5G</a>.</p>\n<p>As the maker of most consumer gizmos with a computer chip inside, China is also the source of an incredible number of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are not only poorly secured, but are probably more accurately described as <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/who-makes-the-iot-things-under-attack/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insecure by design</a>.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration said it would continue its previously announced plans <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity/cybersecurity-labeling-consumers-0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to develop a system of labeling that could be applied to various IoT products</a> and give consumers some idea of how secure the products may be. But it remains unclear how those labels might apply to products made by companies outside of the United States.<span id=\"more-62912\"></span></p>\n<h2>FIGHTING BADNESS IN THE CLOUD</h2>\n<p>One could convincingly make the case that the world has witnessed yet another historic transfer of wealth and trade secrets over the past decade &#8212; in the form of ransomware and data ransom attacks by Russia-based cybercriminal syndicates, as well as Russian intelligence agency operations like <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/solarwinds-breach/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the U.S. government-wide Solar Winds compromise</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-48090\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cloudrain.jpg\" width=\"714\" /></p>\n<p>On the ransomware front, the White House strategy seems to focus heavily on building the capability to disrupt the digital infrastructure used by adversaries that are threatening vital U.S. cyber interests. The document points to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/international-action-targets-emotet-crimeware/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the 2021 takedown of the Emotet botnet</a> &#8212; a cybercrime machine that was heavily used by multiple Russian ransomware groups &#8212; as a model for this activity, but says those disruptive operations need to happen faster and more often.</p>\n<p>To that end, the Biden administration says it will expand the capacity of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Investigative_Joint_Task_Force\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force</a> (NCIJTF), the primary federal agency for coordinating cyber threat investigations across law enforcement agencies, the intelligence community, and the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To increase the volume and speed of these integrated disruption campaigns, the Federal Government must further develop technological and organizational platforms that enable continuous, coordinated operations,&#8221; the strategy observes. &#8220;The NCIJTF will expand its capacity to coordinate takedown and disruption campaigns with greater speed, scale, and frequency. Similarly, DoD and the Intelligence Community are committed to bringing to bear their full range of complementary authorities to disruption campaigns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The strategy anticipates the U.S. government working more closely with cloud and other Internet infrastructure providers to quickly identify malicious use of U.S.-based infrastructure, share reports of malicious use with the government, and make it easier for victims to report abuse of these systems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given the interest of the cybersecurity community and digital infrastructure owners and operators in continuing this approach, we must sustain and expand upon this model so that collaborative disruption operations can be carried out on a continuous basis,&#8221; the strategy argues. &#8220;Threat specific collaboration should take the form of nimble, temporary cells, comprised of a small number of trusted operators, hosted and supported by a relevant hub. Using virtual collaboration platforms, members of the cell would share information bidirectionally and work rapidly to disrupt adversaries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But here, again, there is a carrot-and-stick approach: The administration said it is taking steps to implement <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01714/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Order (EO) 13984</a> &#8211;issued by the Trump administration in January 2021 &#8212; which requires cloud providers to verify the identity of foreign persons using their services.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All service providers must make reasonable attempts to secure the use of their infrastructure against abuse or other criminal behavior,&#8221; the strategy states. &#8220;The Administration will prioritize adoption and enforcement of a risk-based approach to cybersecurity across Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers that addresses known methods and indicators of malicious activity including through implementation of EO 13984.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Ted Schlein</strong>, founding partner of the cybersecurity venture capital firm <a href=\"https://ballisticventures.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ballistic Ventures</a>, said how this gets implemented will determine whether it can be effective.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adversaries know the NSA, which is the elite portion of the nation\u2019s cyber defense, cannot monitor U.S.-based infrastructure, so they just use U.S.-based cloud infrastructure to perpetrate their attacks,&#8221; Schlein said. &#8220;We have to fix this. I believe some of this section is a bit pollyannaish, as it assumes a bad actor with a desire to do a bad thing will self-identify themselves, as the major recommendation here is around KYC (\u2018know your customer\u2019).\u201d</p>\n<h2>INSURING THE INSURERS</h2>\n<p>One brief but interesting section of the strategy titled &#8220;Explore a Federal Cyber Insurance Backdrop&#8221; contemplates the government&#8217;s liability and response to a too-big-to-fail scenario or &#8220;catastrophic cyber incident.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will explore how the government can stabilize insurance markets against catastrophic risk to drive better cybersecurity practices and to provide market certainty when catastrophic events do occur,&#8221; the strategy reads.</p>\n<p>When the Bush administration released the first U.S. national cybersecurity strategy 20 years ago after the 9/11 attacks, the popular term for that same scenario was a &#8220;digital Pearl Harbor,&#8221; and there was a great deal of talk then about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2004/12/08/tougher-cyber-security-measures-urged/486553db-5e09-4bfb-96c1-cd4ab9105724/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">how the cyber insurance market would soon help companies shore up their cybersecurity practices</a>.</p>\n<p>In the wake of countless ransomware intrusions, many companies now hold cybersecurity insurance to help cover the considerable costs of responding to such intrusions. Leaving aside the question of whether insurance coverage has helped companies improve security, what happens if every one of these companies has to make a claim at the same time?</p>\n<p>The notion of a Digital Pearl Harbor incident struck many experts at the time as a hyperbolic justification for expanding the government&#8217;s digital surveillance capabilities, and an overstatement of the capabilities of our adversaries. But back in 2003, most of the world&#8217;s companies didn&#8217;t host their entire business in the cloud.</p>\n<p>Today, nobody questions the capabilities, goals and outcomes of dozens of nation-state level cyber adversaries. And these days, a catastrophic cyber incident could be little more than an extended, simultaneous outage at multiple cloud providers.</p>\n<p>The full national cybersecurity strategy is available from <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the White House website</a> (PDF).</p>"

In each case, the goal of the attackers was the same: Phish T-Mobile employees for access to internal company tools, and then convert that access into a cybercrime service that could be hired to divert <em>any</em> T-Mobile user&#8217;s text messages and phone calls to another device.</p>\n<p>The conclusions above are based on an extensive analysis of <strong>Telegram</strong> chat logs from three distinct cybercrime groups or actors that have been identified by security researchers as particularly active in and effective at &#8220;<strong>SIM-swapping</strong>,&#8221; which involves temporarily seizing control over a target&#8217;s mobile phone number.</p>\n<p>Countless websites and online services use SMS text messages for both password resets and multi-factor authentication. This means that stealing someone&#8217;s phone number often can let cybercriminals hijack the target&#8217;s entire digital life in short order &#8212; including access to any financial, email and social media accounts tied to that phone number.</p>\n<p>All three SIM-swapping entities that were tracked for this story remain active in 2023, and they all conduct business in open channels on the instant messaging platform Telegram. KrebsOnSecurity is not naming those channels or groups here because they will simply migrate to more private servers if exposed publicly, and for now those servers remain a useful source of intelligence about their activities.</p>\n<p>Each advertises their claimed access to T-Mobile systems in a similar way. At a minimum, every SIM-swapping opportunity is announced with a brief &#8220;<em>Tmobile up!&#8221;</em> or &#8220;<em>Tmo up!</em>&#8221; message to channel participants. Other information in the announcements includes the price for a single SIM-swap request, and the handle of the person who takes the payment and information about the targeted subscriber.</p>\n<p>The information required from the customer of the SIM-swapping service includes the target&#8217;s phone number, and <a href=\"https://www.hologram.io/blog/whats-an-iccid-number-and-why-does-it-matter-for-cellular-iot/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the serial number</a> tied to the new SIM card that will be used to receive text messages and phone calls from the hijacked phone number.</p>\n<p>Initially, the goal of this project was to count how many times each entity claimed access to T-Mobile throughout 2022, by cataloging the various &#8220;Tmo up!&#8221; posts from each day and working backwards from Dec. 31, 2022.</p>\n<p>But by the time we got to claims made in the middle of May 2022, completing the rest of the year&#8217;s timeline seemed unnecessary. The tally shows that in the last seven-and-a-half months of 2022, these groups collectively made SIM-swapping claims against T-Mobile on 104 separate days &#8212; often with multiple groups claiming access on the same days.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_62908\" style=\"width: 760px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tmodates.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62908\" height=\"497\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tmodates.png\" width=\"750\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-62908\">The 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools.</p></div>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity shared a large amount of data gathered for this story with T-Mobile. The company declined to confirm or deny any of these claimed intrusions. But in a written statement, T-Mobile said this type of activity affects the entire wireless industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And we are constantly working to fight against it,&#8221; the statement reads. &#8220;We have continued to drive enhancements that further protect against unauthorized access, including enhancing multi-factor authentication controls, hardening environments, limiting access to data, apps or services, and more. We are also focused on gathering threat intelligence data, like what you have shared, to help further strengthen these ongoing efforts.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>TMO UP!</h2>\n<p>While it is true that each of these cybercriminal actors periodically offer SIM-swapping services for other mobile phone providers &#8212; including <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Verizon</strong> and smaller carriers &#8212; those solicitations appear <em>far</em> less frequently in these group chats than T-Mobile swap offers. And when those offers do materialize, they are considerably more expensive.</p>\n<p>The prices advertised for a SIM-swap against T-Mobile customers in the latter half of 2022 ranged between USD $1,000 and $1,500, while SIM-swaps offered against AT&amp;T and Verizon customers often cost well more than twice that amount.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62880\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mobiletheft.png\" width=\"707\" /></p>\n<p>To be clear, KrebsOnSecurity is not aware of specific SIM-swapping incidents tied to any of these breach claims. However, the vast majority of advertisements for SIM-swapping claims against T-Mobile tracked in this story had two things in common that set them apart from random SIM-swapping ads on Telegram.</p>\n<p>First, they included an offer to use a mutually trusted &#8220;middleman&#8221; or escrow provider for the transaction (to protect either party from getting scammed). More importantly, the cybercriminal handles that were posting ads for SIM-swapping opportunities from these groups generally did so on a daily or near-daily basis &#8212; often teasing their upcoming swap events in the hours before posting a &#8220;Tmo up!&#8221; message announcement.</p>\n<p>In other words, if the crooks offering these SIM-swapping services were ripping off their customers or claiming to have access that they didn&#8217;t, this would be almost immediately obvious from the responses of the more seasoned and serious cybercriminals in the same chat channel.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of people on Telegram claiming to have SIM-swap access at major telecommunications firms, but a great many such offers are simply four-figure scams, and any pretenders on this front are soon identified and banned (<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/09/violence-as-a-service-brickings-firebombings-shootings-for-hire/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if not worse</a>).</p>\n<p>One of the groups that reliably posted &#8220;Tmo up!&#8221; messages to announce SIM-swap availability against T-Mobile customers also reliably posted &#8220;Tmo down!&#8221; follow-up messages announcing exactly when their claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools was discovered and revoked by the mobile giant.</p>\n<p>A review of the timestamps associated with this group&#8217;s incessant &#8220;Tmo up&#8221; and &#8220;Tmo down&#8221; posts indicates that while their claimed access to employee tools usually lasted less than an hour, in some cases that access apparently went undiscovered for several hours or even days.<span id=\"more-62757\"></span></p>\n<h2>TMO TOOLS</h2>\n<p>How could these SIM-swapping groups be gaining access to T-Mobile&#8217;s network as frequently as they claim? Peppered throughout the daily chit-chat on their Telegram channels are solicitations for people urgently needed to serve as &#8220;callers,&#8221; or those who can be hired to social engineer employees over the phone into navigating to a phishing website and entering their employee credentials.</p>\n<p><strong>Allison Nixon </strong>is chief research officer for the New York City-based cybersecurity firm <a href=\"https://unit221b.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unit 221B</a>. Nixon said these SIM-swapping groups will typically call employees on their mobile devices, pretend to be someone from the company&#8217;s IT department, and then try to get the person on the other end of the line to visit a phishing website that mimics the company&#8217;s employee login page.</p>\n<p>Nixon argues that many people in the security community tend to discount the threat from voice phishing attacks as somehow &#8220;low tech&#8221; and &#8220;low probability&#8221; threats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see it as not low-tech at all, because there are a lot of moving parts to phishing these days,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;You have the caller who has the employee on the line, and the person operating the phish kit who needs to spin it up and down fast enough so that it doesn&#8217;t get flagged by security companies. Then they have to get the employee on that phishing site and steal their credentials.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition, she said, often there will be yet another co-conspirator whose job it is to use the stolen credentials and log into employee tools. That person may also need to figure out how to make their device pass &#8220;posture checks,&#8221; a form of device authentication that some companies use to verify that each login is coming only from employer-issued phones or laptops.</p>\n<p>For aspiring criminals with little experience in scam calling, there are plenty of sample call transcripts available on these Telegram chat channels that walk one through how to impersonate an IT technician at the targeted company &#8212; and how to respond to pushback or skepticism from the employee. Here&#8217;s a snippet from one such tutorial that appeared recently in one of the SIM-swapping channels:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hello this is James calling from Metro IT department, how&#8217;s your day today?&#8221;</p>\n<p>(yea im doing good, how r u)</p>\n<p>i&#8217;m doing great, thank you for asking</p>\n<p>i&#8217;m calling in regards to a ticket we got last week from you guys, saying you guys were having issues with the network connectivity which also interfered with [Microsoft] Edge, not letting you sign in or disconnecting you randomly. We haven&#8217;t received any updates to this ticket ever since it was created so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m calling in just to see if there&#8217;s still an issue or not&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>TMO DOWN!</h2>\n<p>The TMO UP data referenced above, combined with comments from the SIM-swappers themselves, indicate that while many of their claimed accesses to T-Mobile tools in the middle of 2022 lasted hours on end, both the frequency and duration of these events began to steadily decrease as the year wore on.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-45224\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/phonescam.png\" width=\"751\" /></p>\n<p>T-Mobile declined to discuss what it may have done to combat these apparent intrusions last year. However, one of the groups began to complain loudly in late October 2022 that T-Mobile must have been doing something that was causing their phished access to employee tools to die very soon after they obtained it.</p>\n<p>One group even remarked that they suspected T-Mobile&#8217;s security team had begun monitoring their chats.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the timestamps associated with one group&#8217;s TMO UP/TMO DOWN notices show that their claimed access was often limited to less than 15 minutes throughout November and December of 2022.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, the calendar graphic above clearly shows that the frequency of claimed access to T-Mobile decreased significantly across all three SIM-swapping groups in the waning weeks of 2022.</p>\n<h2>SECURITY KEYS</h2>\n<p>T-Mobile US reported revenues of nearly $80 billion last year. It currently employs more than 71,000 people in the United States, any one of whom can be a target for these phishers.</p>\n<p>T-Mobile declined to answer questions about what it may be doing to beef up employee authentication. But <strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong>, a researcher and lecturer at University of California, Berkeley&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">International Computer Science Institute</a>, said T-Mobile and all the major wireless providers should be requiring employees to use physical security keys for that second factor when logging into company resources.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_28417\" style=\"width: 269px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-28417\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/yubikey-285x346.png\" width=\"259\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-28417\">A U2F device made by Yubikey.</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;These breaches should not happen,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;Because T-Mobile should have long ago issued all employees security keys and switched to security keys for the second factor. And because security keys provably block this style of attack.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most commonly used security keys are inexpensive USB-based devices. A security key implements a form of multi-factor authentication known as Universal 2nd Factor (U2F), which allows the user to complete the login process simply by inserting the USB key and pressing a button on the device. The key works without the need for any special software drivers.</p>\n<p>The allure of U2F devices for multi-factor authentication is that even if an employee who has enrolled a security key for authentication tries to log in at an impostor site, the company\u2019s systems simply refuse to request the security key if the user isn\u2019t on their employer\u2019s legitimate website, and the login attempt fails. Thus, the second factor cannot be phished, either over the phone or Internet.</p>\n<h2>THE ROLE OF MINORS IN SIM-SWAPPING</h2>\n<p>Nixon said one confounding aspect of SIM-swapping is that these criminal groups tend to recruit teenagers to do their dirty work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A huge reason this problem has been allowed to spiral out of control is because children play such a prominent role in this form of breach,&#8221; Nixon said.</p>\n<p>Nixon said SIM-swapping groups often advertise low-level jobs on places like <strong>Roblox</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong>, online games that are extremely popular with young adolescent males.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Statistically speaking, that kind of recruiting is going to produce a lot of people who are underage,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They recruit children because they&#8217;re naive, you can get more out of them, and they have legal protections that other people over 18 don&#8217;t have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, she said, even when underage SIM-swappers are arrested, the offenders tend to go right back to committing the same crimes as soon as they&#8217;re released.</p>\n<p>In January 2023, T-Mobile <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/new-t-mobile-breach-affects-37-million-accounts/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed</a> that a &#8220;bad actor&#8221; stole records on roughly 37 million current customers, including their name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, and T-Mobile account number.</p>\n<p>In August 2021, T-Mobile acknowledged that hackers made off with the names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license/ID information on more than 40 million current, former or prospective customers who applied for credit with the company. That breach came to light after\u00a0<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-breach-exposed-ssn-dob-of-40m-people/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a hacker began selling the records on a cybercrime forum</a>.</p>\n<p>In the shadow of such mega-breaches, any damage from the continuous attacks by these SIM-swapping groups can seem insignificant by comparison. But Nixon says it&#8217;s a mistake to dismiss SIM-swapping as a low volume problem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Logistically, you may only be able to get a few dozen or a hundred SIM-swaps in a day, but you can pick <em>any</em> customer you want across their entire customer base,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just because a targeted account takeover is low volume doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s low risk. These guys have crews that go and identify people who are high net worth individuals and who have a lot to lose.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nixon said another aspect of SIM-swapping that causes cybersecurity defenders to dismiss the threat from these groups is the perception that they are full of low-skilled &#8220;script kiddies,&#8221; a derisive term used to describe novice hackers who rely mainly on point-and-click hacking tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They underestimate these actors and say this person isn&#8217;t technically sophisticated,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But if you&#8217;re rolling around in millions worth of stolen crypto currency, you can buy that sophistication. I know for a fact some of these compromises were at the hands of these &#8216;script kiddies,&#8217; but they&#8217;re not ripping off other people&#8217;s scripts so much as hiring people to make scripts for them. And they don&#8217;t care what gets the job done, as long as they get to steal the money.&#8221;</p>"

We don&#8217;t know much about the source of the November 2021 incident, other than GoDaddy&#8217;s statement that it involved a compromised password, and that it took about two months for the company to detect the intrusion. GoDaddy has not disclosed the source of the breach in December 2022 that led to malware on some customer websites.</p>\n<p>But we do know the March 2020 attack was precipitated by <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/03/phish-of-godaddy-employee-jeopardized-escrow-com-among-others/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a spear-phishing attack against a GoDaddy employee</a>. GoDaddy described the incident at the time in general terms as a social engineering attack, but one of its customers affected by that March 2020 breach actually spoke to one of the hackers involved.</p>\n<p>The hackers were able to change the Domain Name System (DNS) records for the transaction brokering site <strong>escrow.com</strong> so that it pointed to an address in Malaysia that was host to just a few other domains, including the <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/d6de464d-f30d-4350-8324-d0f8997daf38/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">then brand-new phishing domain</a> <strong>servicenow-godaddy[.]com</strong>.</p>\n<p>The general manager of Escrow.com found himself on the phone with one of the GoDaddy hackers, after someone who claimed they worked at GoDaddy called and said they needed him to authorize some changes to the account.</p>\n<p>In reality, the caller had just tricked a GoDaddy employee into giving away their credentials, and he could see from the employee&#8217;s account that Escrow.com required a specific security procedure to complete a domain transfer.</p>\n<p>The general manager of Escrow.com said he suspected the call was a scam, but decided to play along for about an hour &#8212; all the while recording the call and coaxing information out of the scammer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This guy had access to the notes, and knew the number to call,&#8221; to make changes to the account, the CEO of Escrow.com told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;He was literally reading off the tickets to the notes of the admin panel inside GoDaddy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>About halfway through this conversation &#8212; after being called out by the general manager as an imposter &#8212; the hacker admitted that he was not a GoDaddy employee, and that he was in fact part of a group that enjoyed repeated success with social engineering employees at targeted companies over the phone.</p>\n<p>Absent from GoDaddy&#8217;s SEC statement is another spate of attacks in November 2020, in which unknown intruders <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/godaddy-employees-used-in-attacks-on-multiple-cryptocurrency-services/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">redirected email and web traffic for multiple cryptocurrency services</a> that used GoDaddy in some capacity.</p>\n<p>It is possible this incident was not mentioned because it was the work of yet another group of intruders. But in response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity at the time, GoDaddy said that incident also stemmed from a &#8220;limited&#8221; number of GoDaddy employees falling for a sophisticated social engineering scam.<span id=\"more-62835\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;As threat actors become increasingly sophisticated and aggressive in their attacks, we are constantly educating employees about new tactics that might be used against them and adopting new security measures to prevent future attacks,&#8221; GoDaddy said in a written statement back in 2020.</p>\n<p>Voice phishing or &#8220;vishing&#8221; attacks typically target employees who work remotely. The phishers will usually claim that they\u2019re calling from the employer\u2019s IT department, supposedly to help troubleshoot some issue. The goal is to convince the target to enter their credentials at a website set up by the attackers that mimics the organization\u2019s corporate email or VPN portal.</p>\n<p>Experts interviewed for an <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/voice-phishers-targeting-corporate-vpns/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">August 2020 story on a steep rise in successful voice phishing attacks</a> said there are generally at least two people involved in each vishing scam: One who is social engineering the target over the phone, and another co-conspirator who takes any credentials entered at the phishing page &#8212; including multi-factor authentication codes shared by the victim &#8212; and quickly uses them to log in to the company&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>The attackers are usually careful to do nothing with the phishing domain until they are ready to initiate a vishing call to a potential victim. And when the attack or call is complete, they disable the website tied to the domain.</p>\n<p>This is key because many domain registrars will only respond to external requests to take down a phishing website if the site is live at the time of the abuse complaint. This tactic also can stymie efforts by companies that focus on identifying newly-registered phishing domains before they can be used for fraud.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_28417\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-28417\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/yubikey.png\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-28417\">A U2F device made by Yubikey.</p></div>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s latest SEC filing indicates the company had nearly 7,000 employees as of December 2022. In addition, GoDaddy contracts with another 3,000 people who work full-time for the company via business process outsourcing companies based primarily in India, the Philippines and Colombia.</p>\n<p>Many companies now require employees to supply a one-time password &#8212; such as one sent via SMS or produced by a mobile authenticator app &#8212; in addition to their username and password when logging in to company assets online. But both SMS and app-based codes can be undermined by phishing attacks that simply request this information in addition to the user&#8217;s password.</p>\n<p>One multifactor option \u2014 physical security keys \u2014 appears to be immune to these advanced scams. The most commonly used security keys are inexpensive USB-based devices. A security key implements a form of multi-factor authentication known as Universal 2nd Factor (U2F), which allows the user to complete the login process simply by inserting the USB device and pressing a button on the device. The key works without the need for any special software drivers.</p>\n<p>The allure of U2F devices for multi-factor authentication is that even if an employee who has enrolled a security key for authentication tries to log in at an impostor site, the company\u2019s systems simply refuse to request the security key if the user isn\u2019t on their employer\u2019s legitimate website, and the login attempt fails. Thus, the second factor cannot be phished, either over the phone or Internet.</p>\n<p>In July 2018, Google <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed</a> that it had not had any of its 85,000+ employees successfully phished on their work-related accounts since early 2017, when it began requiring all employees to use physical security keys in place of one-time codes.</p>"

But according to <a href=\"https://www.bitsight.com/blog/mylobot-investigating-proxy-botnet\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a new report</a> from <strong>BitSight</strong>, the Mylobot botnet&#8217;s main functionality has always been about transforming the infected system into a proxy.</p>\n<p>The Mylobot malware includes more than 1,000 hard-coded and encrypted domain names, any one of which can be registered and used as control networks for the infected hosts. BitSight researchers found significant overlap in the Internet addresses used by those domains and a domain called <strong>BHproxies[.]com</strong>.</p>\n<p>BHProxies sells access to &#8220;residential proxy&#8221; networks, which allow someone to rent a residential IP address to use as a relay for their Internet communications, providing anonymity and the advantage of being perceived as a residential user surfing the web. The service is currently advertising access to more than 150,000 devices globally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At this point, we cannot prove that BHProxies is linked to Mylobot, but we have a strong suspicion,&#8221; wrote BitSight&#8217;s <strong>Stanislas Arnoud</strong>.</p>\n<p>To test their hypothesis, BitSight obtained 50 proxies from BHProxies. The researchers were able to use 48 of those 50 proxies to browse to a website they controlled &#8212; allowing them to record the true IP addresses of each proxy device.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Among these 48 recovered residential proxies IP addresses, 28 (58.3%) of those were already present in our sinkhole systems, associated with the Mylobot malware family,&#8221; Arnoud continued. &#8220;This number is probably higher, but we don&#8217;t have a full visibility of the botnet. This gave us clear evidence that Mylobot infected computers are used by the BHProxies service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>BitSight said it is currently seeing more than 50,000 unique Mylobot infected systems every day, and that India appears to be the most targeted country, followed by the United States, Indonesia and Iran.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe we are only seeing part of the full botnet, which may lead to more than 150,000 infected computers as advertised by BHProxies\u2019 operators,&#8221; Arnoud wrote.</p>\n<h2>WHO&#8217;S BEHIND BHPROXIES?</h2>\n<p>The website BHProxies[.]com has been advertised for nearly a decade on the forum <strong>Black Hat World</strong> by the user <strong>BHProxies</strong>. BHProxies has authored 129 posts on Black Hat World since 2012, and their last post on the forum was in December 2022. </p>\n<p>BHProxies initially was fairly active on Black Hat World between May and November 2012, after which it suddenly ceased all activity.

A search on jesus.fn.christ@gmail.com at <a href=\"https://www.constellaintelligence.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Constella Intelligence</a>, a company that tracks compromised databases, shows this email address is tied to an account at the fundraising platform <strong>omaze.com,</strong> for a <strong>Brian Shotliff</strong> from Chesterland, Ohio.</p>\n<p>Reached via LinkedIn, Mr. Shotliff said he sold his BHProxies account to another Black Hat World forum user from Egypt back in 2014. Shotliff shared an April 2014 password reset email from Black Hat World, which shows he forwarded the plaintext password to the email address <strong>legendboy2050@yahoo.com</strong>. He also shared a PayPal receipt and snippets of Facebook Messenger logs showing conversations in March 2014 with legendboy2050@yahoo.com.</p>\n<p>Constella Intelligence confirmed that legendboy2050@yahoo.com was indeed another email address tied to the hassan_isabad_subar/BHProxies identity on Black Hat World.

This is a big deal because in 2022, organized crime groups <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/10/how-card-skimming-disproportionally-affects-those-most-in-need/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">began massively targeting EBT accounts</a> &#8212; often emptying affected accounts at ATMs <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-08/ebt-fraud-la-county\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">immediately after the states disperse funds each month</a>.</p>\n<p>EBT cards can be used along with a personal identification number (PIN) to pay for goods at participating stores, and to withdraw cash from an ATM. However, EBT cards differ from debit cards issued to most Americans in two important ways. First, most states do not equip EBT cards with smart chip technology, which can make the cards more difficult and expensive for skimming thieves to clone.</p>\n<p>More critically, EBT participants traditionally have had little hope of recovering food assistance funds when their cards were copied by card-skimming devices and used for fraud. That&#8217;s because while the EBT programs are operated by individually by the states, those programs are funded by the <strong>U.S. Department of Agriculture</strong> (USDA), which until late last year was barred from reimbursing states for stolen EBT funds.</p>\n<p>The protections passed in the 2023 Appropriations Act allow states to use federal funds to replace stolen EBT benefits, and they permit states to seek reimbursement for any skimmed EBT funds they may have replaced from their own coffers (dating back to Oct. 1, 2022).</p>\n<p>But first, all 50 states must each submit a plan for how they are going to protect and replace food benefits stolen via card skimming. Guidance for the states in drafting those plans was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023.01.31-State-Plan-Guidance-Replacement-of-Stolen-Benefits-a.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued by the USDA on Jan. 31</a> (PDF), and states that don&#8217;t get them done before Feb. 27, 2023 risk losing the ability to be reimbursed for EBT fraud losses.</p>\n<p><strong>Deborah Harris</strong> is a staff attorney at <strong>The Massachusetts Law Reform Institute</strong> (MLRI), a nonprofit legal assistance organization that has closely tracked the EBT skimming epidemic. In November 2022, the MLRI <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/lawsuit-seeks-food-benefits-stolen-by-skimmers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">filed a class-action lawsuit against Massachusetts</a> on behalf of thousands of low-income families who were collectively robbed of more than $1 million in food assistance benefits by card skimming devices secretly installed at cash machines and grocery store checkout lanes across the state.</p>\n<p>Harris said she&#8217;s pleased that the USDA guidelines were issued so promptly, and that the guidance for states was not overly prescriptive. For example, some security experts have suggested that adding contactless capability to EBT cards could help participants avoid skimming devices altogether. But Harris said contactless cards do not require a PIN, which is the only thing that stops EBT cards from being drained at the ATM when a participant&#8217;s card is lost or stolen.</p>\n<p>Then again, nothing in the guidance even mentions chip-based cards, or any other advice for improving the physical security of EBT cards. Rather, it suggests states should seek to develop the capability to perform basic fraud detection and alerting on suspicious transactions, such as when an EBT card that is normally used only in one geographic area suddenly is used to withdraw cash at an ATM halfway across the country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides having the states move fast to approve their plans, we&#8217;d also like to see a focused effort to move states from magstripe-only cards to chip, and also assisting states to develop the algorithms that will enable them to identify likely incidents of stolen benefits,&#8221; Harris said.</p>\n<p>Harris said Massachusetts has begun using algorithms to look for these suspicious transaction patterns throughout its EBT network, and now has the ability to alert households and verify transactions. But she said most states do not have this capability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have heard that other states aren&#8217;t currently able to do that,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;But encouraging states to more affirmatively identify instances of likely theft and assisting with the claims and verification process is critical. Most households can&#8217;t do that on their own, and in Massachusetts it&#8217;s very hard for a person to get a copy of their transaction history. Some states can do that through third-party apps, but something so basic should not be on the burden of EBT households.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some states aren&#8217;t waiting for direction from the federal government to beef up EBT card security. Like Maryland, which identified more than 1,400 households hit by EBT skimming attacks last year &#8212; a tenfold increase over 2021.<span id=\"more-62561\"></span></p>\n<p>Advocates for EBT beneficiaries in Maryland are backing <a href=\"https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2023RS/bills/sb/sb0401f.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Senate Bill 401</a> (PDF), which would require the use of chip technology and ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity (a hearing on SB401 is scheduled in the Maryland Senate Finance Commission for Thursday, Feb. 23, at 1 p.m.).</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle Salomon Madaio</strong> is a director at the <a href=\"https://www.hprplaw.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Homeless Persons Representation Project</a>,\u00a0a legal assistance organization based in Silver Spring, Md. Madaio said the bill would require the state Department of Human Services to replace skimmed benefits, not only after the bill goes into effect but also retroactively from January 2020 to the present.</p>\n<p>Madaio said the bill also would require the state to monitor for patterns of suspicious activity on EBT cards, and to develop a mechanism to contact potentially affected households.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For most of the skimming victims we&#8217;ve worked with, the fraudulent transactions would be pretty easy to spot because they mostly happened in the middle of the night or out of state, or both,&#8221; Madaio said. &#8220;To make matters worse, a lot of families whose benefits were scammed then incurred late fees on many other things as a result.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to see why organized crime groups have pounced on EBT cards as easy money. In most traditional payment card transactions, there are usually several parties that have a financial interest in minimizing fraud and fraud losses, including the bank that issued the card, the card network (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, etc.), and the merchant.</p>\n<p>But that infrastructure simply does not exist within state EBT programs, and it certainly isn&#8217;t a thing at the inter-state level. What that means is that the vast majority of EBT cards have zero fraud controls, which is exactly what continues to make them so appealing to thieves.</p>\n<p>For now, the only fraud controls available to most EBT cardholders include being especially paranoid about where they use their cards, and frequently changing their PINs.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/usda-snapskim.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">USDA guidance</a> issued prior to the passage of the appropriations act, EBT cardholders <em>should consider changing their card PIN at least once a month</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By changing PINs frequently, at least monthly, and doing so before benefit issuance dates, households can minimize their risk of stolen benefits from a previously skimmed EBT card,&#8221; the USDA advised.</p>"

In a court filing this week, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-31264\" height=\"132\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lastpass-580x132.png\" width=\"580\" /></p>\n<p>On March 6, federal prosecutors in northern California said they seized approximately $24 million worth of cryptocurrencies that were clawed back following a $150 million cyberheist on Jan. 30, 2024. The complaint refers to the person robbed only as &#8220;Victim-1,&#8221; but according to blockchain security researcher <strong>ZachXBT</strong> the theft was perpetrated against <strong>Chris Larsen</strong>, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency platform <strong>Ripple</strong>.</p>\n<p>ZachXBT was the <a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1752694489905528943\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first to report on the heist</a>, of which approximately $24 million was frozen by the feds before it could be withdrawn. This week&#8217;s action by the government merely allows investigators to officially seize the frozen funds.</p>\n<p>But there is an important conclusion in this seizure document: It basically says the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> and the <strong>FBI</strong> agree with the findings of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/experts-fear-crooks-are-cracking-keys-stolen-in-lastpass-breach/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the LastPass breach story published here in September 2023</a>. That piece quoted security researchers who said they were witnessing six-figure crypto heists several times each month that they believed all appeared to be the result of crooks cracking master passwords for the password vaults stolen from LastPass in 2022.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating these data breaches, and law enforcement agents investigating the instant case have spoken with FBI agents about their investigation,&#8221; reads the seizure complaint, which was written by a U.S. Secret Service agent. &#8220;From those conversations, law enforcement agents in this case learned that the stolen data and passwords that were stored in several victims\u2019 online password manager accounts were used to illegally, and without authorization, access the victims\u2019 electronic accounts and steal information, cryptocurrency, and other data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The document continues:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on this investigation, law enforcement had probable cause to believe the same attackers behind the above-described commercial online password manager attack used a stolen password held in Victim 1\u2019s online password manager account and, without authorization, accessed his cryptocurrency wallet/account.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Working with dozens of victims, security researchers <strong>Nick Bax</strong> and <strong>Taylor Monahan</strong> found that none of the six-figure cyberheist victims appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto theft, such as the compromise of one\u2019s email and/or mobile phone accounts, or SIM-swapping attacks.</p>\n<p>They discovered the victims all had something else in common: Each had at one point stored their cryptocurrency seed phrase &#8212; the secret code that lets anyone gain access to your cryptocurrency holdings &#8212; in the &#8220;Secure Notes&#8221; area of their LastPass account prior to the 2022 breaches at the company.</p>\n<p>Bax and Monahan found another common theme with these robberies: They all followed a similar pattern of cashing out, rapidly moving stolen funds to a dizzying number of drop accounts scattered across various cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>\n<p>According to the government, a similar level of complexity was present in the $150 million heist against the Ripple co-founder last year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The scale of a theft and rapid dissipation of funds would have required the efforts of multiple malicious actors, and was consistent with the online password manager breaches and attack on other victims whose cryptocurrency was stolen,&#8221; the government wrote. &#8220;For these reasons, law enforcement agents believe the cryptocurrency stolen from Victim 1 was committed by the same attackers who conducted the attack on the online password manager, and cryptocurrency thefts from other similarly situated victims.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reached for comment, LastPass said it has seen no definitive proof &#8212; from federal investigators or others &#8212; that the cyberheists in question were linked to the LastPass breaches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since we initially disclosed this incident back in 2022, LastPass has worked in close cooperation with multiple representatives from law enforcement,&#8221; LastPass said in a written statement. &#8220;To date, our law enforcement partners have not made us aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident. In the meantime, we have been investing heavily in enhancing our security measures and will continue to do so.&#8221;<span id=\"more-70634\"></span></p>\n<p>On August 25, 2022,\u00a0<strong>LastPass CEO Karim Toubba</strong> told users the company had detected unusual activity in its software development environment, and that the intruders stole some source code and proprietary LastPass technical information. On Sept. 15, 2022, LastPass said an investigation into the August breach determined the attacker did not access any customer data or password vaults.</p>\n<p>But on Nov. 30, 2022, LastPass notified customers about another, far more serious security incident that the company said leveraged data stolen in the August breach. LastPass disclosed that criminal hackers had compromised encrypted copies of some password vaults, as well as other personal information.</p>\n<p>Experts say the breach would have given thieves &#8220;offline&#8221; access to encrypted password vaults, theoretically allowing them all the time in the world to try to crack some of the weaker master passwords using powerful systems that can attempt millions of password guesses per second.</p>\n<p>Researchers found that many of the cyberheist victims had chosen master passwords with relatively low complexity, and were among LastPass&#8217;s oldest customers. That&#8217;s because legacy LastPass users were more likely to have master passwords that were protected with far fewer &#8220;iterations,&#8221; which refers to the number of times your password is run through the company&#8217;s encryption routines. In general, the more iterations, the longer it takes an offline attacker to crack your master password.</p>\n<p>Over the years, LastPass forced new users to pick longer and more complex master passwords, and they increased the number of iterations on multiple occasions by several orders of magnitude. But researchers found strong indications that LastPass never succeeded in upgrading many of its older customers to the newer password requirements and protections.</p>\n<p>Asked about LastPass&#8217;s continuing denials, Bax said that after the initial warning in our 2023 story, he naively hoped people would migrate their funds to new cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While some did, the continued thefts underscore how much more needs to be done,&#8221; Bax told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;It&#8217;s validating to see the Secret Service and FBI corroborate our findings, but I\u2019d much rather see fewer of these hacks in the first place. ZachXBT and <a href=\"https://x.com/_SEAL_Org/status/1868805837311074576\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SEAL 911\u00a0reported yet another wave of thefts</a> as recently as December, showing the threat is still very real.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Monahan said\u00a0LastPass still hasn\u2019t alerted their customers that their secrets\u2014especially those stored in \u201cSecure Notes\u201d\u2014may be at risk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Its been two and a half years since LastPass was first breached [and] hundreds of millions of dollars has been stolen from individuals and companies around the globe,&#8221; Monahan said. &#8220;They could have encouraged users to rotate their credentials. They could\u2019ve prevented millions and millions of dollars from being stolen by these threat actors. But\u00a0 instead they chose to deny that their customers were are risk and blame the victims instead.&#8221;</p>"

The group is reportedly staffed by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 50 technologists</a>, many of whom have ties to Musk&#8217;s companies.</p>\n<p>DOGE has been enabling the president&#8217;s ongoing mass layoffs and firings of federal workers, largely by seizing control over computer systems and government data for a multitude of federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to find another person connected to DOGE who has stronger ties to Musk than Branden Spikes. A native of California, Spikes initially teamed up with Musk in 1997 as a lead systems engineer for the software company Zip2, the first major venture for Musk. In 1999, Spikes was hired as director of IT at PayPal, and in 2002 he became just the fourth person hired at SpaceX.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Spikes launched <strong>Spikes Security</strong>, a software product that sought to create a compartmentalized or &#8220;sandboxed&#8221; web browser that could insulate the user from malware attacks. A review of spikes.com in the Wayback Machine shows that as far back as 1998, Musk could be seen joining Spikes for team matches in the online games Quake and Quake II. In 2016, Spikes Security was merged with another security suite called Aurionpro, with the combined company renamed Cyberinc.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70608\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-70608\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikesquake.png\" width=\"748\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70608\">A snapshot of spikes.com from 1998 shows Elon Musk&#8217;s profile in Spike&#8217;s clan for the games Quake and Quake II.</p></div>\n<p>Spikes&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandenspikes/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn profile</a> says he was appointed head of IT at X in February 2025. And although his name shows up on none of the lists of DOGE employees circulated by various media outlets, multiple sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Spikes was working with DOGE and operates within Musk&#8217;s inner circle of trust.</p>\n<p>In a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity, Spikes said he is dedicated to his country and to saving it from what he sees as certain ruin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Myself, I was raised by a southern conservative family in California and I strongly believe in America and her future,&#8221; Spikes said. &#8220;This is why I volunteered for two months in DC recently to help DOGE save us from certain bankruptcy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity that he recently decided to head back home and focus on his job as director of IT at X.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I loved it, but ultimately I did not want to leave my hometown and family back in California,&#8221; Spikes said of his tenure at DOGE. &#8220;After a couple of months it became clear that to continue helping I would need to move to DC and commit a lot more time, so I politely bowed out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prior to founding Spikes Security, Branden Spikes was married to a native Russian woman named <strong>Natalia</strong> whom he&#8217;d met at a destination wedding in South America in 2003.</p>\n<p>Branden and Natalia&#8217;s names are both on the registration records for the domain name <strong>orangetearoom[.]com</strong>. This domain, which DomainTools.com says was originally registered by Branden in 2009, is the home of a tax-exempt charity in Los Angeles called the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141221061648/http://www.russiancalifornia.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>California Russian Association</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Here is a photo from a 2011 event organized by the California Russian Association, showing Branden and Natalia at one of its &#8220;White Nights&#8221; charity fundraisers:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70585\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-70585\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikes-heritage.png\" width=\"749\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70585\">Branden and Natalia Spikes, on left, in 2011.

That is not her maiden name, which appears to be &#8220;Libina.&#8221; Rather, Natalia acquired the surname Haldeman in 1998, when she married Elon Musk&#8217;s cousin.</p>\n<p><strong>Reeve Haldeman</strong> is the son of <strong>Scott Haldeman</strong>, who is the brother of Elon Musk&#8217;s mother, <strong>Maye Musk</strong>.

Podvalov is a board member of the <strong>Congress of Russian Americans</strong> (CRA), a nonprofit group that is known for vehemently opposing U.S. financial and legal sanctions against Russia.</p>\n<p>Writing for <em>The Insider</em> in 2022, journalist <strong>Diana Fishman</strong> described how the CRA has engaged in outright political lobbying, noting that the organization in June 2014 sent a letter to President Obama and the secretary of the United Nations, calling for an end to the &#8220;large-scale US intervention in Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The US military contingents must be withdrawn immediately from the Eastern European region, and NATO&#8217;s enlargement efforts and provocative actions against Russia must cease,\u201d the message read.</p>\n<p>The Insider said the CRA director sent another two letters, this time to President Donald Trump, in 2017 and 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One was a request not to sign a law expanding sanctions against Russia,&#8221; Fishman <a href=\"https://theins.ru/en/politics/256825\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>. &#8220;The other regretted the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the United States and urged not to jump to conclusions on Moscow&#8217;s involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The nonprofit tracking website CauseIQ.com <a href=\"https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/russian-heritage-foundation,831537424/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that The Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc. is now known as <strong>Constellation of Humanity</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Russian Heritage Foundation and the California Russian Association both promote the interests of <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/an-unorthodox-russian-vision-of-heaven-and-hell/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Russian Orthodox Church</a>. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141119232054/http://www.russiancalifornia.org/russian-orthodox-church-orange-county/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">This page</a> indexed by Archive.org from russiancalifornia.org shows The California Russian Foundation organized a community effort to establish an Orthodox church in Orange County, Calif.</p>\n<p>A press release from the <strong>Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia</strong> (ROCOR) shows that in 2021 the Russian Heritage Foundation <a href=\"https://www.rocorstudies.org/2021/03/09/russian-heritage-foundation-supports-our-work/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">donated money</a> to organize a conference for the Russian Orthodox Church in Serbia.</p>\n<p>A review of the &#8220;<a href=\"https://orangetearoom.com/index.php/network/about-us\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Partners</a>&#8221; listed on the Spikes&#8217; jointly registered domain &#8212; orangetearoom.com &#8212; shows the organization worked with a marketing company called <strong>Russian American Media</strong>. <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/a-close-up-look-at-the-consumer-data-broker-radaris/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reporting by KrebsOnSecurity last year</a> showed that Russian American Media also partners with the problematic people-search service <strong>Radaris</strong>, which was formed by two native Russian brothers in Massachusetts who have built a fleet of consumer data brokers and Russian affiliate programs.</p>\n<p>When asked about his ex-wife&#8217;s history, Spikes said she has a good heart and bears no ill-will toward anyone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I attended several of Natalia&#8217;s social events over the years we were together and can assure you that she&#8217;s got the best intentions with those,&#8221; Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;There&#8217;s no funny business going on. It is just a way for those friendly immigrants to find resources amongst each other to help get settled in and chase the American dream. I mean, they&#8217;re not unlike the immigrants from other countries who come to America and try to find each other and help each other find others who speak the language and share in the building of their businesses here in America.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Spikes said his own family roots go back deeply into American history, sharing that his 6th great grandfather was Alexander Hamilton on his mom&#8217;s side, and Jessie James on his dad&#8217;s side.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My family roots are about as American as you can get,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve also been entrusted with building and safeguarding Elon&#8217;s companies since 1999 and have a keen eye (as you do) for bad actors, so have enough perspective to tell you that Natalia has no bad blood and that she loves America.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, this perspective comes from someone who has the utmost regard for the interests of the &#8220;special government employee&#8221; Mr. Musk, who has been bragging about tossing entire federal agencies into the &#8220;wood chipper,&#8221; and who recently <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/musk-chainsaw-trump-doge-6568e9e0cfc42ad6cdcfd58a409eb312\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wielded an actual chainsaw</a> on stage while referring to it as the &#8220;chainsaw for bureaucracy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Elon&#8217;s intentions are good and you can trust him,&#8221; Spikes assured.</p>\n<p>A special note of thanks for research assistance goes to <strong>Jacqueline Sweet</strong>, an independent investigative journalist whose work has been published in The Guardian, Rolling Stone, POLITICO and The Intercept.</p>"
