The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, and in response enterprises quickly scaled their cloud spend in the third quarter of that same year. Remote work surged, and organizations accelerated their cloud migration plans. Needless to say, Q3 of 2020 saw a massive influx of companies moving to the cloud.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what does a seismic, unexpected shift to cloud services mean for security?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our elite cloud threat researchers utilized data pulled from our global array of sensors and found a correlation between the increased cloud spend due to COVID-19 and security incidents: organizations across the world increased their cloud workloads without fully understanding the security implications, leading to an explosion of cloud security breaches. Despite the migration, our research shows that cloud security programs for many organizations are still in their infancy when it comes to automating security controls (i.e. </span><a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-devsecops\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevSecOps</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2019/07/4-practical-steps-shift-left-security/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shifting left</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Scaling cloud services without automated security controls embedded across the entire development pipeline is a toxic combination.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continue reading to discover the top takeaways from the 1H 2021 Unit 42 Cloud Threat Report, learn about COVID-19\u2019s global impact on security posture, and receive a free download of the full report.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>COVID-19 Cloud Security Incidents Varied By Industry</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first significant takeaway from the Unit 42 research is that cloud security incidents differed depending on the industry. Additionally, there were significant increases in a wide variety of security risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Risks included unencrypted cloud data, public exposure of cloud resources, insecure port configurations, and more.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-137032\" height=\"971\" src=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image6.png\" width=\"1987\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud security incidents for the retail, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manufacturing, and government industries rose by 402%, 230%, and 205%, respectively. These industries were among those facing the greatest pressures to adapt and scale in the face of the pandemic \u2014 retailers needed new ways to quickly provide basic necessities, while manufacturing and government organizations had to deliver COVID-19 supplies and aid. Industries that play crucial roles in combating the pandemic continue to struggle to secure their cloud workloads, underscoring the danger of underinvesting in cloud security.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although cloud infrastructure allows businesses to quickly expand their remote work capabilities, automated security controls around DevOps and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines often lag behind this rapid movement.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptomining Increased While Cryptojacking Decreased</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another takeaway was the discovery of some unexpected trends in regards to cryptomining and cryptojacking. The cryptocurrency industry has always been a popular target for attackers, even before the pandemic. However, Unit 42 research revealed the increase of cryptomining and the decrease of cryptojacking during the outbreak of COVID-19.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/cryptomining\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptomining</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the process of contributing computer processing power to validating blockchain transactions for the reward of getting paid in cryptocurrency. </span><a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/prisma-cloud/waas-cryptojacking-microservice-based-web-apps/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptojacking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a type of cyberattack in which the attackers attempt to stay undetected for as long as possible while hijacking a computer system\u2019s resources to mine cryptocurrency for their own gain.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the COVID-19 pandemic, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Monero (XMR) grew in popularity and market value. While 23% of organizations showed signs of cryptojacking from July through September of 2020, this number decreased to 17% from December 2020 through February 2021. This is the first recorded drop since Unit 42 began tracking cryptojacking trends in 2018.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-137045\" height=\"930\" src=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1.png\" width=\"1762\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unit 42 researchers focused on data associated with Monero (XMR), a cryptocurrency popular with hackers due to its strong anonymity protections and the fact that it can be easily mined in the cloud. The research took place between December 2020 and February 2021. Although the amount of data available does not make it possible to draw definitive conclusions, it appears likely that political and health-related events exert a clear impact on malicious cryptomining operations, at least for some cryptocurrency (such as XMR).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Sensitive Data in the Cloud Remains Publicly Exposed</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final takeaway from our research was that organizations have neglected to invest in the cloud governance and automated security controls necessary to protect their workloads as they move to the cloud. 30% of organizations exposed some form of sensitive content to the internet, such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, or healthcare and financial data. For reference, anyone who knows or can guess the organization\u2019s URLs can access this data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When this data is exposed directly to the internet, organizations face significant risks associated with unauthorized access and regulatory compliance violations. This degree of exposure suggests that organizations continue to struggle to enforce proper access controls for the hundreds of data storage buckets that may operate in the cloud, especially when those buckets are spread across multiple cloud providers and accounts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In turn, organizations have created serious business risks, such as inviting breaches through sensitive open ports. Organizations must now build a cloud security program focused evenly around all phases of the software development lifecycle to avoid this threat. Doing so will enable them to not only win in the market, but also to establish sustainable cloud security programs that can expand and contract, no matter what types of unpredictable events take place in the future.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Cloud Spend Must Match Cloud Security Investment</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While our previous </span><a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/unit42-cloud-threat-research\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unit 42 Cloud Threat Report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> identified similar problems, the numerous crises unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic have further amplified the need for a strong cloud security strategy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For organizations that are ready to identify the threats in their cloud environment, </span><a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prisma Cloud</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> analyzes more than 10 billion incidents every month.

The websites sought to persuade millions of consumers into buying products backed by bogus endorsements purporting to be from celebrities including Stephen Hawking, Jennifer Lopez and Gwen Stefani.</p>\n<p>The compromised sites were uncovered in an investigation by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researcher Jeff White, who examined a massive campaign in which affiliate marketers used spam to push victims to sites where they were sometimes tricked into unknowingly signing up for expensive subscriptions for goods. He discovered the network after noticing striking visual similarities in templates used to build websites selling seemingly unrelated goods -- from diet pills and brain boosters to CBD oil.</p>\n<p>GoDaddy reviewed Unit 42\u2019s findings and discovered the sites had been pointing to subdomains belonging to several hundred customers whose accounts had been compromised using legitimate credentials. The attackers most likely accessed those credentials through phishing scams that tricked customers into releasing passwords and also through credential stuffing, which is when hackers exploit the use of the same passwords to secure multiple accounts by taking login data stolen from one site and using it to access another.</p>\n<p>GoDaddy shut down the compromised subdomains in March, prompting affected customers to reset their passwords and notified them that a security action had been taken.</p>\n<p>Unit 42 has published <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/takedowns-and-adventures-in-deceptive-affiliate-marketing/\">a detailed report </a>on the investigation, in which White describes how he discovered the network as part of a two-year deep dive into the world of affiliate marketing, how he mapped out the network\u2019s infrastructure and uncovered the malicious subdomains that he reported to GoDaddy. It describes how victims are targeted with \u00a0spam containing shortened links that direct them to websites on compromised accounts that forward them to sites offering products promising miraculous results.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-98322 alignright\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-1.25.34-PM-500x327.png\" width=\"344\" />Unit 42 recommends that consumers be on guard for similar online scams, particularly when considering purchasing goods promoted through email. Users should research all products marketed via email or online ads to determine if it they legitimate. The products highlighted in White\u2019s research report all had multiple complaints that were easy to find online. A good rule of thumb is the old adage \u201cif it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d</p>\n<p>To prevent accounts from being compromised, Palo Alto Networks recommends securing all accounts with unique, strong passwords and implementing two-factor authentication whenever it is offered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2019/04/unit-42-godaddy-shutter-subdomains-selling-miracles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unit 42, GoDaddy Shutter Subdomains Selling Miracles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Palo Alto Networks Blog</a>.</p>"}], "wfw_commentrss": "https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2019/04/unit-42-godaddy-shutter-subdomains-selling-miracles/feed/", "slash_comments": "0"}, {"title": "Exploring DNS Abuse", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/category/threat-research/feed/", "value": "Exploring DNS Abuse"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2019/03/exploring-dns-abuse/"}], "link": "https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2019/03/exploring-dns-abuse/", "comments": "https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2019/03/exploring-dns-abuse/#respond", "authors": [{"name": "Unit 42"}], "author": "Unit 42", "author_detail": {"name": "Unit 42"}, "published": "Fri, 15 Mar 2019 16:00:48 +0000", "published_parsed": [2019, 3, 15, 16, 0, 48, 4, 74, 0], "readtime": "1", "featuredimage": "", "tags": [{"term": "Threat Research", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "DNS", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "id": "https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/?p=97633", "guidislink": false, "summary": "<p>Unit 42 researchers have released a report showing how attackers can abuse DNS to hide their tracks when they infiltrate networks and steal data using a technique known as \u201cDNS Tunneling.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2019/03/exploring-dns-abuse/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exploring DNS Abuse</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Palo Alto Networks Blog</a>.</p>", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/category/threat-research/feed/", "value": "<p>Unit 42 researchers have released a report showing how attackers can abuse DNS to hide their tracks when they infiltrate networks and steal data using a technique known as \u201cDNS Tunneling.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2019/03/exploring-dns-abuse/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exploring DNS Abuse</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Palo Alto Networks Blog</a>.</p>"}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/category/threat-research/feed/", "value": "<p>DNS is a critical foundation of the Internet.
