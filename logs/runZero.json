Both CVE-2021-45466 (a file write vulnerability) and CVE-2021-45467 (a file inclusion vulnerability) are interesting individually, but they provide a powerful attack vector when chained together to achieve pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) on a vulnerable target. Taking into account the 200k+ unique, public-facing servers currently running CWP, there could be many systems at risk of exploitation."

Tracked as CVE-2021-43798 with a &ldquo;high&rdquo; CVSS score of 7.5, this path traversal vulnerability resides in the installed plugins path logic for a Grafana instance (e.g., &lt;grafana_host_url&gt;/public/plugins/&lt;plugin-id&gt;).
